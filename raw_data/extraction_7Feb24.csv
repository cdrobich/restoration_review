No revegetation had been attempted at any of the mined sites. Mining had occurred from 7–40 years prior to our floristic inventory, and the size of both the mined sites and the unmined controls ranged from less than 1 to greater than 20 ha.

Polyhaline tidal marsh zone, comparing accreting sediments of a formerly diked, restored marsh (SG - restored in 2009) to a historic (reference) marsh (AS - never diked or leveed).
Marsh sediment cores were collected with a Hargis corer along transects perpendicular to sloughs at two locations: in close proximity to Puget Sound and approximately 1 km upstream of Puget Sound. Cores were collected in April 2015 and May 2017, sealed airtight, transported on ice, and processed. 
Cores were sectioned into 2 cm sections, weighed wet, dried at 80°C, and weighed again. Dry bulk density (BD) was determined, and samples were ground to pass through a 2 mm sieve for homogenization. Core sections were analyzed for dry BD, total % carbon, and % organic carbon (%OC) using a Costech ECS 4010 CHNS/O elemental analyzer. Loss on ignition (LOI) was determined for organic matter content by burning samples at 550°C for 4 hours.

210Pb dating was used for AS cores to estimate age-depth relationships with the constant rate of supply (CRS) method.
SG cores, disturbed by approximately 100 years of farming and grazing, were not analyzed for 210Pb. The onset of restoration (November 2009) was identified based on a sharp decrease in BD between newly deposited salt marsh sediments and underlying farm soils.

Two-sample t-tests were used to determine significant differences in BD, %OC, vertical accretion (VA) rates, and carbon accumulation or sequestration rates (CARs) between AS and SG sites.
LOI data were analyzed using the Kruskal–Wallis test, and a simple linear regression was used to determine the relationship between LOI and %OC.",Says restoration culminated in 2009 ,Abiotic,,,1,,,,,,,,,,1,1,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
