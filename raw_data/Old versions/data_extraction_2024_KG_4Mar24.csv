Marsh sediment cores were collected with a Hargis corer along transects perpendicular to sloughs at two locations: in close proximity to Puget Sound and approximately 1 km upstream of Puget Sound. Cores were collected in April 2015 and May 2017, sealed airtight, transported on ice, and processed. 
Cores were sectioned into 2 cm sections, weighed wet, dried at 80°C, and weighed again. Dry bulk density (BD) was determined, and samples were ground to pass through a 2 mm sieve for homogenization. Core sections were analyzed for dry BD, total % carbon, and % organic carbon (%OC) using a Costech ECS 4010 CHNS/O elemental analyzer. Loss on ignition (LOI) was determined for organic matter content by burning samples at 550°C for 4 hours.

210Pb dating was used for AS cores to estimate age-depth relationships with the constant rate of supply (CRS) method.
SG cores, disturbed by approximately 100 years of farming and grazing, were not analyzed for 210Pb. The onset of restoration (November 2009) was identified based on a sharp decrease in BD between newly deposited salt marsh sediments and underlying farm soils.

Two-sample t-tests were used to determine significant differences in BD, %OC, vertical accretion (VA) rates, and carbon accumulation or sequestration rates (CARs) between AS and SG sites.

The Willamette Valley spans 9,100 km2 between the Coast Range and Cascade Mountains, while the LCRV extends 235 km upstream from the mouth at the Pacific Ocean to Bonneville Dam. The climate is cool Mediterranean with warm dry summers and cool wet winters.
Sampling Design: Seasonal wetlands on WRP easements and reference sites on state Wildlife Management Areas (WMA) and federal National Wildlife Refuges (NWR) were sampled. Criteria for selection included wetland size, enrollment duration, and landowner permission. Sampling occurred in 2008 and 2009, with 14 WRP easements and 10 reference wetlands selected each year.
Wetland Management: Wetlands were categorized as unmanaged, passively managed, or actively managed based on the presence and extent of management practices such as water control infrastructure and vegetation management.
Sampling Procedures: Wetlands were sampled for plant species composition and seed biomass using systematic sampling methods. Plant percent cover and seed biomass were estimated within sampling frames, and soil cores were collected for seed analysis.
Sample Processing: Seeds were processed separately for inflorescence, vacuum, and soil core samples. Seeds were identified to species or genus, dried, and weighed. Plant data were prepared for analysis by calculating mean percent cover for each species in each wetland.
Statistical Analysis: Multi-response permutation procedures (MRPP) and indicator species analyses (ISA) were used to assess differences in plant community composition between WRP easements and reference wetlands. Mixed effects models and general linear models were employed to test for differences in seed biomass between wetland types and management intensities.",,Vegetation,,,,1,1,1,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Seismic lines were mounded every 6 meters, with planting densities of around 1,300 stems per hectare. Mounding was accomplished using a 20 tonne construction excavator with a bucket attachment. Site preparation was completed by excavating and inverting material, forming a mound of mineral and organic soil and an adjacent depression. Equipment operators were instructed to make mounds that were 0.75 m in width, 1 m in length, and 0.80 m in height, allowing for settling, which was expected to occur with mounded organics. Three mounds were placed across the width of the seismic line, in a diamond or checkered pattern, regardless of the seismic line width.

Each site consisted of paired plots: one on the seismic line and one in the adjacent forest (reference). Tree regeneration and forest stand conditions were measured along 30-meter transects.
Regeneration Density Analysis: Generalized linear mixed effects models were used to analyze tree regeneration density in relation to restoration area, treatment, plot location, and stand characteristics. Separate analyses were conducted for each ecosite due to their influence on regeneration patterns.
Regeneration Patterns Based on Seismic Line Characteristics: Regeneration density was analyzed with respect to seismic line characteristics such as orientation, width, stand conditions, and ground cover.

The reed-removal treatment involved herbiciding/cutting the reeds in the summer of 1996, resulting in no plant growth in the treated site the following year (1996) and a thick layer of plant litter covering the area. By July 1997, the litter layer had disappeared, likely lost to export during winter storms, and small seedlings of various plant species were observed.
Equilibrators were constructed and deployed to collect porewater samples, and sediment cores were collected for denitrification enzyme assays. Equilibrators were placed in each vegetation plot before treatment (September 1995) and during mid-July of 1996–1998. Porewater was collected and analyzed for ions (NO3-, PO4-, NH4+) using ion chromatography and automated wet chemistry. Additionally, total organic matter and sediment water content were measured in sediment cores collected near the equilibrator locations.

Biomass was collected from living plants, litter was collected from the ground surface, and belowground biomass was collected using a metal corer to a depth of 15 cm.
The reed-removal treatment involved herbiciding/cutting the reeds in the summer of 1996, resulting in no plant growth in the treated site the following year (1996) and a thick layer of plant litter covering the area. By July 1997, the litter layer had disappeared, likely lost to export during winter storms, and small seedlings of various plant species were observed.
Equilibrators were constructed and deployed to collect porewater samples, and sediment cores were collected for denitrification enzyme assays. Equilibrators were placed in each vegetation plot before treatment (September 1995) and during mid-July of 1996–1998. Porewater was collected and analyzed for ions (NO3-, PO4-, NH4+) using ion chromatography and automated wet chemistry. Additionally, total organic matter and sediment water content were measured in sediment cores collected near the equilibrator locations.

Sites varied in their characteristics, including vegetation cover, peat accumulation, and restoration status. Two sites were in a small peatland surrounded by harvested areas, with dense shrub and Sphagnum moss cover. Some sites were actively vacuum-harvested and devoid of vegetation, while others were restored by raising the water table and applying plant material containing Sphagnum diaspores and mulch.
Sites harvested with block-cutting techniques and abandoned for over 30 years showed varied vegetation, from sparse cover of birch trees to dense patches of cotton-grass. Some areas were naturally vegetated after block-cutting, with ridges having small trees and shrubs and trenches having dense mosses, sedges, and shrubs.
Peat Sample Collection and Preparation: In September 1999, triplicate cores were collected from each site, down to 1 m or at least 10 cm below the water table. Surface vegetation was removed, and samples were divided into 10 cm depth segments, ensuring separation of peat above and below the water table. Samples were stored in sealed plastic bags on ice to minimize oxygen exposure, especially for samples collected beneath the water table.
Laboratory incubations focused on peat from the top 10 cm or just below living vegetation and from the 10 cm above and below the water table, with adjustments for sites where the water table was at or near the surface.
Roots were removed, and samples were homogenized by hand.
Laboratory Analyses: Peat decomposition was assessed using the von Post measure, with values ranging from 1 (no decomposition) to 10 (complete humification).
Aerobic and anaerobic incubations were conducted to determine CO2 and CH4 production and oxidation potentials. Aerobic incubations involved placing peat and distilled water in sealed flasks, sampled daily for four days to measure CO2 production potential. Anaerobic incubations required evacuation of flasks with a vacuum pump and flushing with O2-free N2, sampled over 30 days to measure CH4 and CO2 production. Gas analysis was conducted using gas chromatographs equipped with flame ionization detectors, with concentrations determined relative to standards and rates calculated based on changes in headspace concentrations over time.","Says one natural bog and two cut-over peatlands - picked peatlands for wetland class, also says restoration 2, 4 and 30 years prior to sampling, sampling was in 1999 ",Abiotic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,1,,,,,,,,

This area includes significant portions of North Dakota, South Dakota, Minnesota, Iowa, and Montana.  A systematic sampling design, stratified by physiographic region, was used to select a representative geographic sample of wetlands along the climatic and land-use gradients in the PPR. Sampling points were identified along the medial portions of each physiographic region, and wetlands were selected near each sampling point based on categories such as restored wetlands, drained wetlands, non-drained wetlands, and reference wetlands. Sampling: soil samples, specifically invertebrate egg bank samples, were collected from 203 wetlands over the period of June to September 1997. Four randomly established transects were selected from the center to the outer edge of each wetland, and three soil cores were collected along each transect in the wet-meadow and shallow-marsh zones. These samples were stored in freezers until needed for laboratory experiments. Incubation experiments: conducted in a controlled environment room using aquaria. Four experimental trials were carried out to incubate soils from all wetland replicates. The trials were based on wetland class and physiographic region, with specific start dates for each trial. During the experiments, wetland soils were placed in glass aquaria containing water adjusted to specific conductance levels typical of seasonal and semi-permanent wetlands. The samples were incubated for six weeks, with temperatures maintained at 10°C for the first three weeks and then raised to 20°C for the remainder of the experiment. Invertebrates were harvested every two weeks, and all harvested invertebrates were enumerated and identified.
Statistical analyses: were performed to assess the influence of wetland categories (drained, restored, non-drained, and reference) on the abundance and taxon richness of invertebrates. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used, with wetland class-physiographic region combinations treated as blocked designs. Prior to analysis, abundance data were transformed to stabilize variances. Fisher’s protected least significant difference tests were used for assessing individual differences when main effects were significant. Simple linear regression was employed to examine the relationship between invertebrate taxon richness and abundance and restoration age.

Eight catchments were situated in cropland, while the other eight were in restored grassland enrolled in the Conservation Reserve Program (CRP).

In the cropland catchments, the wetland zones were tilled when soil moisture conditions allowed and left idle when excessively wet, while adjacent upland zones were tilled most years. Soybeans were planted in adjacent uplands and urea was applied as fertilizer. In 2003, some wetland zones were tilled in the spring, and all sites were inundated and contained hydrophytes during at least part of the study period from May to October.

The wetland zones of the grassland catchments were similar, having a farming history before enrollment in the CRP. During the study period, all grassland sites were inundated, with wetland vegetation consisting mainly of hydrophytes, while adjacent upland zones were dominated by perennial grasses.

Gas emission samples were collected biweekly from May to October 2003 using the static chamber method. Five permanent chamber bases were installed in each wetland along a transect extending from the wetland center to the wetland-upland transition zone. Gas samples were collected from each chamber at the end of a 1-hour accumulation period and analyzed for N2O, CH4, and CO2 concentrations using gas chromatography. Soil moisture and temperature were measured at each base location, and soil cores were collected for analysis of organic carbon, total nitrogen, and bulk density.

Flux values for N2O, CH4, and CO2 were calculated for each collection chamber on each sample date and adjusted by the area of the corresponding emission zone to obtain an area-adjusted flux value for the entire wetland zone. Statistical analysis, including analysis of variance, was conducted to assess the effects of land use and sample date on various soil and gas emission parameters.","May not want to include, compares disturbed area to a restored area but doesn't have a reference condition, got too far into coding before I realized - also unsure if enrollment into wetland reserve program is actually a restoration activity or not ",Abiotic,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,1,,,,,1,,,,,1,1,1,,,,,,,,

Historically, the area was covered by a mosaic of forest and bog, but much of the forest was removed during the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. Currently, peatlands are either being extracted or are in various stages of passive recovery. Untouched bog fragments serve as reference sites for evaluating restoration efforts. Block-Cut Peat Extraction: The traditional block-cut method of peat extraction involved several stages, including excavation of drainage ditches, removal of surface vegetation, extraction of peat blocks, and excavation of secondary drainage ditches. The resulting pattern of alternating trenches and baulks remains identifiable decades after abandonment. The abandoned trenches, at least 10-15 m wide, were the focus of the study. Study Sites and Sampling: Six abandoned block-cut peatlands were surveyed in the Bas-Saint-Laurent region, with sites revisited 10 years later. Restoration efforts were undertaken in some sectors of the peatlands, involving blocking primary drainage ditches to increase water levels. Seven unmanaged bog fragments nearby were used as reference sites. Vegetation surveys were conducted using established transects across each trench. Data Processing and Statistical Analyses: Redundancy analysis (RDA) was used to assess plant composition development in abandoned trenches left to spontaneous revegetation. Vegetation data were Hellinger transformed, and peat properties, hydrological, and landscape descriptors were used as explanatory variables. The success of restoration was evaluated by comparing species cover in rewetted and non-rewetted trenches, with statistical significance determined using non-parametric tests.",,Vegetation,,,,1,1,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

",1-5 years,"Study Site: This study was conducted in the Alloway Creek Watershed in Salem County, New Jersey, within the brackish portion of the Delaware Bay. It focused on assessing arthropod food webs in invaded and restored salt marsh habitats as part of a large salt marsh restoration project undertaken by the Public Service Enterprises Group (PSEG). Restoration efforts began in 1996 with the removal of Phragmites, an invasive plant species, using glyphosate herbicide applications, followed by spot applications in subsequent years. Most restored areas had reverted to Spartina within five years.

The study sampled arthropod assemblages in four different habitat types: reference Spartina, restored Spartina, mixed Spartina–Phragmites, and Phragmites. Detailed vegetation cover maps from 1996 to 2000 were used to determine the history of vegetation cover and Phragmites invasion for each sampling location.

Arthropod sampling was conducted using a D-vac suction sampler, with samples collected along transects within each habitat type. Internal or concealed feeding insects were also sampled by dissecting stems from each sampling station in the laboratory.

Stable isotope analysis was performed to compare arthropod food webs in different marsh habitats. Isotope signatures of arthropods were analyzed in relation to the dominant vegetation (Spartina or Phragmites) at each sampling site. A mixing model was used to estimate the relative contribution of detritus/algal feeders, herbivores, and other predators to the diets of spiders in each habitat type.

Statistical analyses, including mixed-model ANOVA and three-source mixing models, were conducted to compare differences in stable isotope signatures among habitat types and estimate the dietary composition of spiders across different marsh habitats.",Unsure how to code for this one ,Macroinvertebrates,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,isotopic food web modelling,,,,,,

Many historic delta marshes were drained and isolated with rock-reinforced levees, leading to marshland loss and invasion by alien plants and animals.
Four study sites were selected in the central delta:
Upper Mandeville Tip (UM): Considered a natural marsh, it was never leveed or directly altered by human activities.
Mildred Island (MI): Previously leveed for approximately 62 years, breached 16 years ago.
Lower Mandeville Tip (LM): Previously leveed for approximately 65 years, breached 65 years ago.
Venice Cut (VC): Previously leveed for approximately 67 years, breached 67 years ago.
These breached marshes, termed flooded islands, were historically dominated by marsh plains drained by small intertidal sloughs and channels. Subsidence in these areas, primarily due to agricultural activity and wind erosion during the leveed period, is proportional to the number of years the island was leveed prior to being breached.                                                    Sampling Technique: A 4-meter-long ichthyoplankton net with a 0.65-meter mouth diameter and a zooplankton net (110 mm mesh) were brided to a 2.5-meter aluminum boom and deployed from a boat using a bow-anchored rope.
Towing Procedure: Nets were towed just below the water surface, avoiding submerged objects, for 10-minute intervals in each habitat transect per study site.
Sampling Period: Ichthyoplankton were sampled about once per neap tide per month during April–August 1998 and twice per neap tide per month during January–July 1999. Zooplankton were sampled once per neap tide per month during May–June 1998 and March–June 1999.
Water Quality Measurements: Water temperature, specific conductance, water clarity, and water depth were measured before or after each tow.
Preservation: All samples were individually preserved in a 10% formalin solution and transferred to the laboratory for identification.
Statistical analysis: Correlation Analysis: Pearson product-moment correlation tests were used to examine intercorrelations among physical variables to reduce the number of highly correlated predictor variables.
ANOVA Tests: One-way ANOVA tests were used to determine water column depth differences by habitat transect, and two-way ANOVA tests were used to examine intersite and intermonth variation of each water quality variable.

Many historic delta marshes were drained and isolated with rock-reinforced levees, leading to marshland loss and invasion by alien plants and animals.
Four study sites were selected in the central delta:
Upper Mandeville Tip (UM): Considered a natural marsh, it was never leveed or directly altered by human activities.
Mildred Island (MI): Previously leveed for approximately 62 years, breached 16 years ago.
Lower Mandeville Tip (LM): Previously leveed for approximately 65 years, breached 65 years ago.
Venice Cut (VC): Previously leveed for approximately 67 years, breached 67 years ago.
These breached marshes, termed flooded islands, were historically dominated by marsh plains drained by small intertidal sloughs and channels. Subsidence in these areas, primarily due to agricultural activity and wind erosion during the leveed period, is proportional to the number of years the island was leveed prior to being breached.                                                    Sampling Technique: A 4-meter-long ichthyoplankton net with a 0.65-meter mouth diameter and a zooplankton net (110 mm mesh) were brided to a 2.5-meter aluminum boom and deployed from a boat using a bow-anchored rope.
Towing Procedure: Nets were towed just below the water surface, avoiding submerged objects, for 10-minute intervals in each habitat transect per study site.
Sampling Period: Ichthyoplankton were sampled about once per neap tide per month during April–August 1998 and twice per neap tide per month during January–July 1999. Zooplankton were sampled once per neap tide per month during May–June 1998 and March–June 1999.
Water Quality Measurements: Water temperature, specific conductance, water clarity, and water depth were measured before or after each tow.
Preservation: All samples were individually preserved in a 10% formalin solution and transferred to the laboratory for identification.
Statistical analysis: Correlation Analysis: Pearson product-moment correlation tests were used to examine intercorrelations among physical variables to reduce the number of highly correlated predictor variables.
ANOVA Tests: One-way ANOVA tests were used to determine water column depth differences by habitat transect, and two-way ANOVA tests were used to examine intersite and intermonth variation of each water quality variable.
Multivariate Analysis: MANCOVA was used to test for significant differences between the most abundant ichthyoplankton species and predicator variables such as site, habitat type, and year.

Wetlands were within larger state-protected natural areas, while restored wetlands were on privately held lands under wetland protection easements.
Sampling: Natural wetlands were sampled based on dominance by Carex or Phalaris, while restored wetlands were dominated by Phalaris. Elevation differences were measured using a Topcon GRS-1 to assess microtopographic heterogeneity.
Soil Sample Collection: Soil samples were collected from both natural and restored wetlands in 2012 and 2013, with additional sites added in 2013. Samples were collected from areas dominated by Carex and Phalaris in natural wetlands, and from Phalaris-dominated areas in restored wetlands. Six 1-m^2 plots were established in each community type at each site. Soil cores were collected from high and low microtopographic points, composited, and analyzed for denitrification potential, soil moisture, and nutrient concentrations.
Denitrification Potential: Denitrification potential was measured using the denitrification enzyme activity assay (DEA) incubation method.
Soil samples were amended with a DEA solution to remove resource limitations and inhibit bacterial reproduction. Gas samples were collected at intervals over 180 minutes and analyzed using a Gas Chromatograph.

Dikes were constructed between 1933 and 1960 using sediment, with vegetated crests. Study Design:The study design involved comparing wetlands based on shoreline length, sampled at points at least 50 meters apart along the shoreline. At each point, two 10-meter sampling transects were established, one meter and ten meters inland from the waterline, with quadrats evenly spaced along each transect.
Sampling: Seed bank samples were collected from April 19 to May 10, 2002, after frozen conditions thawed. Samples were collected using 10 cm diameter soil cores to a depth of 5 cm, with five samples pooled into a composite sample for each transect. These composite samples were placed in a dark, cool environment until greenhouse space was available. The seed banks were examined using the emergence method, where soil samples were spread over sterilized sand in plastic flats. Half of the samples were subjected to saturation conditions (drawdown treatment), while the other half was flooded. Flats were arranged in a random block design in a greenhouse, with controls for contamination. Germination was monitored, but no germination occurred in the control flats. This involved watering drawdown treatment samples daily and flooded treatment samples as needed to maintain constant water depth. Seedlings were counted and removed when identifiable. The experiment ran from the second week of June 2002 to the third week of November 2002. Unidentifiable seeds in November were transferred to pots and grown until identifiable. Analysis: Species in the seed bank samples were classified into seven habitat guilds based on life history traits and plant community ordinations. Seed densities were expressed as the mean number of germinated seeds per square meter of soil. Vegetation cover was estimated in early August 2002 using a seven-point scale. Soil analysis included pH, organic matter content, nitrogen, available phosphorus, available potassium, and texture. Statistical analysis: no significant differences in the numbers of species and germinated seeds in different habitat guilds at various distances. Two-way ANOVA and Mann-Whitney U tests were used for comparisons between diked and undiked wetlands. Sorenson's similarity index was used to compare species composition between seed banks and vegetation of diked and undiked wetlands.

Dikes were constructed between 1933 and 1960 using sediment, with vegetated crests. Study Design:The study design involved comparing wetlands based on shoreline length, sampled at points at least 50 meters apart along the shoreline. At each point, two 10-meter sampling transects were established, one meter and ten meters inland from the waterline, with quadrats evenly spaced along each transect.
Sampling: Seed bank samples were collected from April 19 to May 10, 2002, after frozen conditions thawed. Samples were collected using 10 cm diameter soil cores to a depth of 5 cm, with five samples pooled into a composite sample for each transect. These composite samples were placed in a dark, cool environment until greenhouse space was available. The seed banks were examined using the emergence method, where soil samples were spread over sterilized sand in plastic flats. Half of the samples were subjected to saturation conditions (drawdown treatment), while the other half was flooded. Flats were arranged in a random block design in a greenhouse, with controls for contamination. Germination was monitored, but no germination occurred in the control flats. This involved watering drawdown treatment samples daily and flooded treatment samples as needed to maintain constant water depth. Seedlings were counted and removed when identifiable. The experiment ran from the second week of June 2002 to the third week of November 2002. Unidentifiable seeds in November were transferred to pots and grown until identifiable. Analysis: Species in the seed bank samples were classified into seven habitat guilds based on life history traits and plant community ordinations. Seed densities were expressed as the mean number of germinated seeds per square meter of soil. Vegetation cover was estimated in early August 2002 using a seven-point scale. Soil analysis included pH, organic matter content, nitrogen, available phosphorus, available potassium, and texture. Statistical analysis: no significant differences in the numbers of species and germinated seeds in different habitat guilds at various distances. Two-way ANOVA and Mann-Whitney U tests were used for comparisons between diked and undiked wetlands. Sorenson's similarity index was used to compare species composition between seed banks and vegetation of diked and undiked wetlands.

Descriptions of each site: 
Dennis Township Salt Hay Farm:  Diked in the 1950s and farmed for salt hay until 1995 when acquired by estuary enhancement program. Minor breaches in perimeter dikes resulted in flooding before acquisition. Restoration plan included creation of six new inlets and associated channels to allow tidal inundation. Restoration construction completed in August 1996, followed by normal daily tidal inundation and drainage.
Maurice River Township Salt Hay Farm: Historically, perimeter dikes were installed to eliminate normal tidal inundation. Breaches in perimeter dikes in 1992 led to uncontrolled flooding, causing loss of vegetative cover. Restoration plan involved creating four new or enlarged inlets and associated channels. Restoration construction completed in early 1998, followed by normal daily tidal inundation and drainage.
Commercial Township Salt Hay Farm: Used for salt hay farming for three generations until storms in 1996 caused breaches in perimeter dikes.
Breaches led to permanent flooding of most areas during the growing season of 1996. Restoration plan included creating 10 inlets and associated channel systems. Construction completed in fall 1997, followed by normal daily tidal inundation and drainage.
Moores Beach-West Reference Marsh: Former salt hay farm that restored naturally after storm damage to perimeter dikes in 1972. By 1992, most of the area had converted to low marsh dominated by S. alterniflora. No improvements made to inlets or channel systems for tidal inundation and drainage. Marsh area designated as reference site encompasses approximately 550 hectares.Mapping Methods: Vegetation mapping of the wetland restoration sites and the reference marshes has been conducted annually since 1995. Aerial photography was acquired during the peak growing season each year at a nominal scale of 1:9600 (1 cm = 60 m). The digital orthophotographs produced from the processed images were used to create digital maps of vegetation coverage. Cover types, including Spartina-dominated marsh vegetation, Phragmites-dominated areas, non-vegetated marsh plains, internal water, channels, and upland/developed land, were identified and mapped using AutoCAD software.",,Vegetation,,,,1,1,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These sites included the Braun farm and the Barnstable farm. Each site comprised a natural forested wetland, a restored herbaceous wetland, and an upland grass buffer strip composed of a mixture of native grasses.
Descriptions of each site: The Braun and Barnstable natural wetlands were each approximately 4 hectares in area, while the Barnstable natural wetland was about 2 hectares. The restored wetlands ranged from approximately 0.4 hectares to 4 hectares. These restored wetlands were restored in 1986 and 1992 to provide wildlife habitat and improve water quality. They were restored to a hydrology similar to depressional wetlands, characterized by high water levels in winter and a growing season drawdown. The upland grass strips served as buffers between fertilized agricultural fields and the wetlands. Sampling: Soil cores were collected from each site in July and August 1997 for analysis of various soil characteristics, including pH, texture, moisture content, bulk density, organic matter content, and phosphorus fractions. Analysis: Soil P fractions were characterized using a sequential extraction procedure to identify nine inorganic and organic soil P fractions. Phosphorus sorption capacity was estimated, and soil Al, Fe, and Ca concentrations were determined.

Deltas differed in size, river discharge, and vegetation composition. Deltas were chosen under the assumption that older dike breach sites were approaching a dynamic morphological equilibrium, making them suitable for comparison with reference marshes.
GIS Analysis: Modern orthophotos were used for manual digitization of tidal marsh features in a GIS. Tidal channel margins and shorelines were digitized to analyze marsh characteristics and changes over time. Channel geometry, island area, perimeter, and other metrics were calculated using GIS tools.
Allometric and Statistical Analysis: Allometric relationships between marsh island area and channel geometry were explored using log-transformed linear regression analysis. ANCOVA was used to compare regression slopes among study sites. Residual analysis was conducted to compare dike breach sites with reference marshes, assessing deviations from regression relationships. Two-way ANOVA was employed to analyze differences in dike breach site residuals compared to reference sites, considering delta location and treatment.
Exploration of Tidal Prism Partitioning: Tidal prism partitioning between sheet flow and channelized flow was investigated by analyzing marsh edge drainage area relative to total marsh island area. Reverse regression was used to predict the marsh area associated with a specific proportion of sheet flow, considering the allometric relationship between marsh area and drainage basin area.",could not find the year of study anywhere?

Mussels (likely Mytilus trossulus) were collected and used as representative consumer organisms for stable isotope analysis, reflecting the composition of particulate organic matter (POM) in the seston. Mussel growth rates were standardized by inundation time between sampling dates, and environmental variables such as temperature, salinity, and seston quality were measured.Primary producer samples from various ecosystem types within the estuary were collected to provide isotopic baselines of primary production available to the mussels. These included marine POM, benthic microalgae, macroalgae, eelgrass, scrub-shrub vegetation, and emergent marsh plants.
Bayesian stable isotope mixing models were employed to estimate the proportional contributions of different organic matter sources to mussel diets. Hierarchical Bayesian modeling allowed for individual diet heterogeneity estimation, incorporating means and variances of OM source isotope signatures and fractionation rates of each isotope.
Statistical analyses: included ANOVAs, non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS), permutational multivariate analysis of variance (PERMANOVA), and distance-based linear modeling (DISTLM). These analyses were used to assess differences in isotopic signatures, OM source assimilation strengths, mussel growth rates, and the relative importance of environmental variables as predictors of growth rates.",,Macroinvertebrates,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"stable isotope analysis of mussel, mussel diet, mussel growth rate ",,,,,,

Study Design: The study utilized a Before-After-Control-Impact (BACI) design to evaluate the restoration. Larval trematode communities were used as indicators of habitat health. Sampling was conducted in July 1997 before the restoration and continued annually from 1998 to 2003.
Sampling Method: Snails (Cerithidea californica) were sampled at four sites within the Ash Avenue parcel (restored sites) and four control sites within the adjacent undisturbed Carpinteria Salt Marsh Reserve. Snails were collected and examined for larval trematode infection.
Data Analysis: The study used statistical analyses to compare trematode prevalence and species richness between restored and control sites. It employed resampling algorithms and calculated proportional differences between control and restored sites to assess restoration effects over time.

Historically, this area has been extensively used for corn and soybean production, prompting restoration efforts supported by federal and state programs to enhance waterfowl habitat and reduce soil erosion.
Sampling: The study evaluated seedling emergence of five Carex species in three restored and three natural wetlands. Seeds were subjected to three treatments: fall unstratified, spring unstratified, and spring stratified. Each treatment involved sowing 300 seeds per species into nine plots per site. Seedlings were monitored monthly during the growing seasons of 2003 and 2004.

Despite the historical prevalence of corn and soybean agriculture in the region, over 90% of wetlands have been drained, prompting restoration efforts supported by various federal and state programs. 
Experimental Design: The study focused on typical restoration sites within the southern prairie pothole region, where wetland plants were allowed to recolonize naturally. To ensure minimal influence from existing wetland plants, only sites drained by subsurface drainage tiles were chosen. Wetlands were reflooded a year prior to the study, and adjacent upland areas were seeded with a prairie seed mix devoid of wetland species. For comparison, natural wetlands of similar size, soil type, and hydrology were selected.
Sampling: Vegetation surveys were conducted to assess on-site vegetation, seed rain, and seed bank patterns. Cover classes were assigned to plant species based on their total cover within each vegetation zone, and voucher specimens were collected for species with a cover class of 5% or greater. Seed rain was evaluated using seed traps placed along transects within the periphery of restored and natural wetlands. Seed traps were collected every six weeks during the growing seasons of 2002 and 2003. Seeds were identified, tallied, and categorized as primary or secondary dispersal events. 
Seed Bank Assay in Restored Wetlands: A seed bank assay was conducted in restored wetlands to assess the presence of remnant seed banks of native hydrophytic perennials. Soil cores were taken from multiple locations across each restored site and subjected to germination trials under greenhouse conditions.
Statistical Analysis: The average annual seed rain per wetland type was determined, and a one-way ANOVA was used to compare seed rain between restored and natural wetlands. Primary seed dispersal rates between restored and natural wetlands were also compared. Sorenson's Similarity Coefficient was used to evaluate the similarity between seed rain and on-site vegetation. Additionally, the species present in the seed bank samples from restored wetlands were compiled for further analysis. ",,Vegetation,,,,1,1,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"seed rain, seed dispersal ",,,,,,

Abundance Analysis: Catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE) was compared among marsh types for individual species and all species combined. Species abundance was transformed prior to analysis, and a two-factor ANOVA was conducted with marsh type and year as factors.
Estuarine Nekton Categories: Individual species were assigned to estuarine categories (resident, transient, freshwater) for comparison of relative abundance.
Environmental Variables Analysis: Temperature, salinity, and dissolved oxygen were analyzed with a two-factor ANOVA with marsh type and year as factors.","intertidal creek is what they call site, does also say agricultural use of area resulted in degredation of wetland allowing for invasion and establishment of P. australis ",Abiotic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,1,,,,,,,

These projects aimed to understand carbon dynamics in wetlands constructed with and without the use of Oil Sands Processed Material (OSPM). The study area was located in northeastern Alberta, Canada, on Syncrude Canada Ltd. and Suncor Energy Inc. mine lease areas and in areas that had not yet been mined.
The wetlands were operationally classified as newly formed (7 years) or older (8+ years) at the time of sampling. Reference wetlands were intentionally constructed or formed opportunistically in depressions in the postmining landscape and contained freshwater from precipitation and runoff. OSPM wetlands were constructed with clay or a combination of clay, sand, and composite tailings as their base and filled with process waters originating from tailings ponds.
Sampling: Sampling was conducted for various components, including macrophytes, macroinvertebrates, microbial biomass and production, stable isotopes, and environmental parameters.
Statistical analysis: The data analysis included two-way ANOVAs for components like emergent and wet-meadow zone macrophyte biomass, CH4, bacterial production, and others. Nonparametric Mann-Whitney tests were used for data sets with significant departures from normality and homoscedasticity. Schematic flow charts were constructed for comparing OSPM and reference wetlands by expressing mean values for each compartment and available flow in the OSPM wetlands as a percentage of a corresponding compartment of the reference wetlands.

Stable isotopes were analyzed to derive additional measures of food web structure, comparing OSPM and reference wetlands. Trophic diversity of invertebrate consumers was estimated from the convex hull area in a d13C–d15N biplot space.

Land use in these watersheds is primarily agricultural and forested, with increasing commercial and residential development. The study site comprises a restored marsh and a natural marsh. The restored marsh was formerly drained for agricultural purposes and restored to capture sediments during increased flow periods and provide waterfowl habitat. The natural marsh has undergone some channel modifications and historical sedimentation.
Water Quality Monitoring: Continuous-record stream flow and water quality gauging stations were installed at various locations in Halfway Creek and Sand Lake Coulee Creek. Water samples were collected at regular intervals for analysis of nutrients (e.g., nitrogen and phosphorus) and sediment concentrations. Storm-event samples were automatically collected using refrigerated samplers triggered by stage changes. Samples were analyzed for various parameters, including total nitrogen, total phosphorus, ammonia, nitrate, and suspended sediment concentrations.
Load Estimation: Nutrient and sediment concentration data, along with stream discharge, were used to compute daily loads. The Graphical Constituent Loading Analysis System (GCLAS) was employed for load calculations.
Yearly loads were estimated by summing daily loads.
Retention of nutrients and sediment by the marsh complex was calculated as the difference between inputs and outputs.
Soil Characteristics and Marsh Complex: Denitrification and nitrification rates were measured using sediment cores collected from various locations within the marsh complex. Experiments were conducted to determine factors limiting denitrification rates. Soil excavation was performed in the restored marsh, and soil cores were analyzed for carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus content.
Statistical Analysis: Data were analyzed for normality and homogeneity of variances. One-way and two-way ANOVAs were conducted to assess differences in denitrification and nitrification rates among sampling locations and periods. Tukey's method was used to test for significant differences among treatment means.

The site experiences annual flooding during the growing season (April 1–Sept 30), lasting between 10 and 45 days depending on floodplain elevation. In June 1998, a straight-line wind event damaged approximately 4.2 hectares of forest within the site, leading to the invasion of reed canarygrass. By 2009, herbicide applications had eliminated reed canarygrass from some areas, allowing a young forest to establish. Deer exclosures were constructed in 2009 to eliminate deer herbivory within exclosures, facilitating comparison with browsed plots. The study includes plots of monoculture reed canarygrass, unbrowsed young forest, browsed young forest, and mature forest.
Sampling: Nutrient sampling involved the deployment of PRS probes in the soil layer (0–15 cm) at each plot. These probes measure nutrient supply rates correlated to the in situ nutrient pool available to plants. Separate anion and cation probes were placed in three subplots within each plot and later composited for analysis. Probes were extracted and replaced every 28 days, totaling four deployments. During the spring flooding period (May through mid-July), all study plots except one mature forest plot were inundated. The duration of flooding varied among plots due to differences in elevation. After this period, all plots remained dry for the remainder of the study.
Statistical analyses: included two-way ANOVA with post-hoc Tukey tests to assess differences among time periods and community types. Analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) was conducted to determine differences among community types after accounting for dry days as a covariate.

The lake, along with Agency Lake to the north, comprises approximately 232 km² with a mean depth of about 2.8 meters. Historically, the region contained numerous wetlands, but approximately 90% have been drained for agricultural purposes over the past century.

The water quality of Upper Klamath Lake has degraded due to increased nutrient loads and sedimentation rates since the mid-20th century, leading to hypereutrophic conditions characterized by massive cyanobacterial blooms, particularly dominated by Aphanizomenon flos-aquae. These blooms, occurring from mid- to late June, result in the formation of buoyant layers over the lake surface. As these blooms decline, oxygen depletion in the water column and lakebed may occur, negatively impacting the survival of endangered fish species like shortnose suckers and Lost River suckers.

On October 30, 2007, engineered levee breaches reintroduced approximately 11 km² of historic wetland to the lake and Williamson River, after being used for crop production for several decades. Three lake sites and three wetland sites were sampled between November 1, 2007, and August 11, 2010, before and after the annual cyanobacterial bloom peak.

The lake sites include a mid-lake site (MDN), a site within the Williamson River plume (WMR), and a site off Modoc Rim (MRM). The wetland sites include one in the Upper Klamath National Wildlife Refuge (WET) and two hydrologically reconnected wetlands near levee breaches (TNC1 and TNC2). The residence time of water varies seasonally in the lake, ranging from approximately 50 days during high-runoff periods to 300 days during low-runoff periods.

The residence time of water varies seasonally in the lake, ranging from approximately 50 days during high-runoff periods to 300 days during low-runoff periods.

Sampling involved deploying nonmetallic porewater profilers to collect samples from six depths to characterize dissolved-solute vertical gradients. Water-column profiles and sediment samples were also collected. Dissolved-solute analyses included trace-element samples analyzed by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) and macronutrient samples determined by spectrophotometry. Benthic flux calculations were based on Fick's law, and principal coordinates analysis (PCO) was used to determine macroinvertebrate assemblage composition similarity among locations and times.",Also measured benthic chlorophyll - unsure how to code ,Benthic infauna,,1,,1,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The undisturbed (reference) part of the site is characterized as a moderately rich fen, with limited forest cover and an average peat depth of 4m. In the disturbed area Peat extraction activities began at this site in 1946 and continued until 2000, covering a total area of 22 ha. Initially a bog, the extracted area exposed peat layers typical of a poor fen after extraction. Restoration efforts commenced in 2008 and concluded in 2009 with the aim of fostering favorable conditions for moss layer development and the recovery of the carbon sink function. Restoration activities involved altering the peatland's hydrology by blocking drainage ditches and constructing dykes to retain snowmelt and elevate the water table. Additionally, moss diaspores harvested from a nearby moderate-rich riverine fen were applied to the restored area at a ratio of 1:10 (1 ha of collected material over 10 ha of restored area), followed by the application of straw mulch.
Sampling: six sampling plots were established in the restored area, arranged in three pairs along the gradient of hydrological conditions. Another set of six plots was established in the nearby undisturbed peatland, with three plots on hummocks and three on hollows. Additionally, four plots with bare peat were monitored at the restored site to assess the effects of vegetation cover on carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4) fluxes.
GHG: CO2 exchanges were assessed using the closed chamber method, with chambers consisting of square or round collars equipped with transparent acrylic lids or opaque covers. Methane fluxes were also assessed using similar chambers equipped with battery-operated fans. Gas samples were collected at regular intervals and analyzed for CH4 concentration using gas chromatography. Ancillary environmental measurements included vegetation volume estimation, soil temperature measurement, and water table depth monitoring.
Statistical analysis: Data analysis involved statistical tests, linear mixed models, and correlation analyses to evaluate differences in fluxes between treatments and years, as well as the influence of environmental variables.

Wetland classification: 14 wetlands were monitored, categorized into three management classifications, actively managed (6 wetlands), passively managed (3 wetlands) and unmanaged agricultural food-plot wetlands (5 wetlands).
Selection Criteria: Actively managed and food-plot wetlands included all wetlands falling into these categories on the refuge. Passively managed wetlands were chosen based on minimal human hydrologic management, with water levels independent of the river but affected by out-of-bank flood events. Agricultural wetlands were located near a channelized portion of the river and were prone to inundation during flood events. A cooperative farming agreement allowed for the cultivation of cash crops while leaving a portion for wildlife food plots.
Sampling: Weekly surveys conducted between late January and early April in 2012 and 2013. Random selection of time period (morning, midday, or afternoon) to prevent time-associated behavior bias. Avoidance of evening surveys due to low light levels.
Survey Procedures: Surveys consisted of behavior scan samples every 10 minutes for 1 hour (seven samples per survey) focusing on ducks. Total waterfowl count conducted. Surveys began after a 30-minute rest period to reduce observer bias. Variable power spotting scope used for observation. Random selection of scan direction. Preference for surveying from a vehicle to reduce observer bias on bird behavior. Subsampling: if large concentrations of ducks were present, wetland extent was divided, and random sampling was conducted.

Muddy Creek marsh had been degraded due to tidal restrictions caused by the construction of a road and culvert system in the early 1900s. Restoration efforts took place in the winter/spring of 2016, involving the replacement of the culvert with a spanning bridge, thereby allowing for the return of nearly full tidal flooding to the degraded marsh. The three reference marshes, on the other hand, were never degraded due to tidal restrictions and were dominated by the native salt marsh grass S. alterniflora.
Sampling:  Sample collection and processing occurred before and after restoration in the degraded marsh and were compared to samples collected from reference marshes. Sampling was conducted in June, August, and October of 2015, before the restoration, and in June, July, August, and October after the restoration, spanning from 2016 to 2017. The first sampling after restoration construction was completed occurred just three months after the restoration. Multiple sites were selected within each habitat type in Muddy Creek marsh and the reference marshes.
Analysis: Various analyses were performed on the collected samples, including nucleic acid extraction and sequence preparation, linear mixed model regression to identify abiotic changes due to restoration, analysis of prokaryotic and fungal community composition, diversity analysis, network analysis, and correlation analysis between community composition and environmental variables. Statistical analysis: linear Mixed Model Regression was used to identify abiotic changes resulting from restoration. It involved fitting a linear mixed-effects model where the environmental parameter served as the response variable, while habitat and year were treated as fixed effects. Sampling site within the marsh and sampling date within the year were considered random effects to account for potential variability within and between sites over time.
Network Analysis: Network analysis was conducted to explore the relationships between different microbial communities sampled from both restored and reference marshes. This involved constructing networks where nodes represented individual samples and edges represented correlations in the abundance of shared prokaryotes or fungi between samples. The analysis aimed to identify modules or clusters of samples that were more interconnected with each other than with samples outside the module. Monte Carlo simulations were used to assess the significance of the observed modularity. Additionally, the network analysis helped in determining the influence of habitat, location (restored vs. reference marshes), and time (sampling year) on microbial community composition. Eigen centrality scores were computed for nodes in the network to identify nodes that were highly connected, indicating their importance in the network structure.
Alpha and Beta Diversity Analysis: Alpha diversity refers to the diversity within individual microbial communities, while beta diversity refers to the diversity between different microbial communities. Alpha diversity was calculated using Shannon diversity index, and differences among restored and reference marshes were tested using linear models or mixed-effects models. Beta diversity was assessed using Bray-Curtis dissimilarities and visualized through principal coordinate analysis (PCoA). Permutational multivariate analysis of variance (PERMANOVA) was conducted to test for significant differences in community composition between restored and reference marshes. Random Forest Modeling:Random forest modeling was employed to determine the most important taxa within sediment samples of each habitat in classifying prokaryotic and fungal communities before and after restoration. This involved building classification models to classify samples based on their restoration status (pre vs. post) using the relative abundances of microbial taxa as features.
The importance of each microbial taxon in classifying the samples was assessed using the GINI index, and the top discriminatory features (ASVs) were visualized.","complicated methodology, not sure I completely understood it all may want to check outcomes ",Microbial,,1,,1,1,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Different sites were chosen based on disturbance history categorized as upper and lower sites.  Lower Bay Sites: Saints Rest Marsh near Saint John, New Brunswick: This site is compared to a reference marsh at Dipper Harbour, located 28 km southwest. Saints Rest Marsh is undergoing recovery. Dipper Harbour: This serves as the reference marsh for comparison with Saints Rest Marsh. Upper Bay Sites: John Lusby Wildlife Sanctuary: This marsh is located on the Nova Scotia coast of the Cumberland Basin and is compared to a reference site, Allen Creek Marsh (also known as Wood Point), located on the opposite shore of the Basin. Allen Creek Marsh (Wood Point): This site serves as the reference marsh for comparison with John Lusby Wildlife Sanctuary.
Since John Lusby Wildlife Sanctuary is considerably larger than the other sites, two subset study areas were chosen for analysis, representative of the variability in the channel network and comparable in size to the area studied at Saints Rest Marsh.
Channel Network and Pool Mapping: Channels, pools, and their elevations were mapped through on-site surveying at each location, covering specific areas of each marsh between 2004 and 2005. 
Various data points were collected using a Carrier Phase Trimble 4700 Differential Global Positioning System. Channels were surveyed based on depth and observed connections to other channels, with a focus on functioning channels capable of carrying both flood and ebb waters. Pools were mapped within specific areas of each marsh, defined as features containing water most of the year with no emergent vascular plants. The length of channel networks, sinuosity, and pool distribution were analyzed using GIS software and spatial pattern analysis packages.
Pre-abandonment channel networks exclusive of agricultural ditches at Saints Rest Marsh were digitized from scanned vertical aerial photographs taken in 1950 and 1958 to compare with present-day networks.

Analysis: Density estimation and comparison were conducted using distance sampling to compare Golden-winged Warbler territory densities between natural shrub wetlands and managed timber harvests. Wetland habitat modeling involved using N-mixture models to examine how abundance varied as a function of habitat covariates while accounting for imperfect detection probability. Habitat relationships were modeled using microhabitat variables and broad-scale habitat covariates at different spatial scales. Model selection was based on Quasi Akaike’s Information Criterion adjusted for small sample size (QAICc).",Study period was between 2014 and 2016,Birds,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Human activities, such as cultivation and drainage for agriculture, have significantly impacted wetland ecosystems, leading to changes in plant species composition and hydrologic regimes. Restoration efforts have been undertaken to mitigate the impacts of wetland drainage, but studies indicate differences in plant species composition and wetland volume between restored and natural wetlands.
Sampling Methods: In July and August of 1995 plant communities in wetlands were sampled in various complexes, including Cottonwood Lake, Hawk’s Nest, Sweet Grass, and Pilgrim’s Rest. Transects radiating from wetland centers were established, and 0.25 m2 plots were randomly located within each wetland vegetation zone. Both native and non-native plant species were identified, and the quality of native plant communities was assessed using various indices, including C¯ and FQI.
Data Analysis: C¯ and FQI values were calculated for each wetland using panel-assigned and data-generated C values based on plant species occurrences in sampled wetlands. Species richness and the percentage of native species were also calculated for each wetland complex.
Plant Species Classification: Native species occurring only in undisturbed native prairie wetlands were considered conservative and assigned higher C values, while those occurring in disturbed wetlands were assigned lower C values based on their frequency of occurrence.",,Vegetation,,,,1,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Dipper Harbour Marsh (reference) located approximately 28 km southwest of Saints Rest Marsh in Dipper Harbour, New Brunswick. Relatively undisturbed compared to Saints Rest Marsh. 
Three study pools selected for monitoring at different elevations on the marshes: high marsh, low marsh, and transition between high and low marsh.
Data Collection: Position and elevation data for pools and drainage patterns were collected using a Trimble 4700 differential Global Positioning System (DGPS). Data were post-processed for accuracy.
Marsh Area Measurement: GPS points were taken around the edge of the marsh at Saints Rest, while air photos were digitized for Dipper Harbour due to terrain constraints. Historic and recent air photos were georeferenced to determine marsh areas.
Pool Identification: Pools were identified based on the absence of emergent vascular plants and consistent water presence. Pool types included ""Ruppia pools"" and ""potholes."" Points were collected around pool edges to estimate size and shape.
Data Collection: Dataloggers recorded temperature at intervals of 5, 16, or 36 minutes. Temperature data were examined by tidal cycle, with tide heights calculated from the Saint John tide gauge data.Data Processing: Corrected data were projected and connected as polygons in ARCMAP 9.1. Spatial analysis tools were used to determine pool and marsh area, buffer analysis, and clustering of pools. Salinity: Salinity was measured at the water and sediment surfaces using a refractometer. Additional measurements were taken to assess spatial variability within pools.
Analysis: A single-factor ANOVA test was performed on surface and bottom salinity measurements. Salinity was monitored monthly and during specific events to assess the effects of tidal flooding and precipitation.",,Abiotic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,1,,,,,,,

Baraboo River Floodplain (restored); originally supported row crop agriculture for at least 50 years before being restored in 2002-2003 by the United States Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS).
Restoration Efforts: Drainage structures were removed, and a water control gate was installed to allow flooding of the site during high flow periods and maintain water levels on the floodplain as the river recedes.
Sampling: occurred simultaneously at both sites on 12 September 2004 to control for temporal variability. A cyclic sampling design was employed to optimize the placement of sampling points, enhancing sampling efficiency by reducing oversampling at small lag distances. Within each site, a nested design was used, with small plots nested within larger plots, allowing for pattern detection at coarse and fine spatial scales. Sampling locations were established in a grid pattern, with transects at 5 m intervals oriented to cardinal directions, creating a grid of potential sampling locations. A 7×7×3 cycle was applied to determine which intersections of the grid were sampled, resulting in a total of 80 flagged locations. A second, smaller grid was laid out within the large plot, and a 7×7×2 cycle was applied to determine sampling locations within this smaller grid, resulting in 36 sampled locations. This sampling protocol allowed for the measurement of lag distances ranging from 35 cm to 350 cm in the small plot and 5 m to 81 m in the large plot.
Soil Analyses: At each marked grid location, a uniformly sized soil sample was collected using a corer to obtain a cylindrical core with dimensions of 8 cm diameter and 12 cm depth. Surface material and vegetation were removed prior to sampling, and samples were sealed in polyethylene bags, refrigerated, and homogenized overnight prior to analysis. Denitrification rates were measured using the acetylene block method with nutrient amendments and forced anoxia to simulate ideal denitrification conditions. Soil samples were amended with organic carbon, nitrate, and chloramphenicol to inhibit de novo enzyme synthesis during the assay period. After incubation, gas samples were collected to measure nitrous oxide (N2O) production rates, which were then used to calculate denitrification rates. Soil samples were weighed, dried, and reweighed to determine soil moisture content. Soil organic matter (OM) was determined by loss on ignition, and total nitrogen (TN) was measured after digestion.
Nitrate concentrations were determined using a KCl extraction method, and concentrations were converted to ?g per g dry soil using site-specific regressions.
Statistical Analysis: Basic descriptive statistics were used to characterize soils among sites and plots, and coefficients of variation (CV) were calculated as a measure of within-plot variability. Mixed model approaches were used to investigate relationships between denitrification and other soil properties at each site, correcting for spatial autocorrelation. Semi-variograms were used to assess spatial variability and pattern in denitrification, OM, TN, nitrate, and moisture for both large and small plots at each site. Omnidirectional semi-variograms were calculated using a robust estimator and standardized to allow for comparisons between sites. Fitted models (spherical, Gaussian, exponential) were used to develop spatial estimates of variable distributions within the study plots.","wetland called floodplain, coded as shallow open water?",Abiotic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,1,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Site Zonation: Three hydrological zones were identified: Zone 1 (seasonally ponded), Zone 2 (seasonally saturated), and Zone 3 (upland).
Zone 0, deeply ponded wetland, was excluded from the study due to its rarity and lack of vegetation.
Transects: Three transects of three plots each were established radially outward from the center of each wetland. Plots were placed centrally within each hydrologic zone using field observation and LiDAR DEMs.
Penetration Resistance: Penetration resistance was measured as an indicator of soil compaction using a penetrometer.Readings were taken at depths of 0-45 cm in sets of 10 measurements, with four sets clustered within each plot.

One site had been subject to vaccum harvesting but had undergone restoration, one site was being mined and the comparison site was a natural bog. 
Assessment Period: August-September 2011, chosen as the best period for identifying helophyte species.
Measurement Method: Vegetation band width associated with the ditch micro-ecosystem was measured at 30 cm intervals along the ditch. The vegetation band was delimited into three zones: center of peat extracted area, vegetated band on margins of ditches, and inside ditches. Vegetation abundance cover was evaluated separately for each zone.
Soil Physicochemistry: Three surficial peat soil samples (from the top 5-7 cm excluding surficial soil crust) were taken in the center of each cutaway field and mixed together prior to analysis. Three surficial soil samples (from coniferous litter) were also taken in each plantation and mixed together prior to analysis. Parameters Analyzed: Bulk density, pH, electrical conductivity (EC), nutrients (total nitrogen, total phosphorus, extractable concentrations of potassium, calcium, magnesium, manganese, sodium, and iron), available phosphorus (PBray), and available ammonium. Analysis Method: Principle Component Analysis (PCA) was used to compare soil physicochemical properties among three ecological groups: cutaway peat fields, afforested peat fields, and reference natural lagg-swamps. Canopy Cover Assessment: Hemispherical photography was used to characterize canopy cover inside plantations. Four pictures were taken in each plantation on three dates during the 2012 growing season, and images were analyzed using Gap Light Analyzer software. Microclimate Assessment: Effects of afforestation on understory microclimate (soil/air humidity and temperature) were assessed using HOBO U23 Pro v2 Temperature/Relative Humidity Data Logger. Two sensors were installed at the soil/air interface in each plantation and one adjacent unrestored cutaway field. Water table level was also measured during visits to the peatland.",,Abiotic,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,1,,1,,1,1,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,

Restoration efforts began in 1999, involving measures like surface tilling, partial filling of drainage ditches with surface debris, construction of bunds along topographic contours, and spreading of Sphagnum diaspores followed by straw mulch.
Field Measurements: Pre-restoration measurements were taken between May and October 1999. Continuous half-hourly fluxes of CO2 and evapotranspiration were measured at the restored site 1.5 m above the peat surface using the eddy covariance technique from May 17 to October 11 in 2000 and 2001.
Instruments included a 3-D sonic anemometer-thermometer (Campbell Scientific CSAT 3) and an open-path infrared gas analyzer (IRGA) (Li7500, LI-COR Inc.). Quality-controlled measurements had an error of approximately 20% prior to correction. Moisture conditions were monitored using multiple-level TDR and tensiometer measurements at various depths. Precipitation was measured using tipping bucket and manual rain gauges, and ground temperature was obtained using continuously logged thermocouple arrays. Eddy covariance sensors were placed at approximately 1.5 m above the peat surface to obtain representative flux data for the restoration site.
Data Analysis: Respiration was separated from tower net ecosystem CO2 exchange (NEE) measurements using ensemble averages of quality nighttime tower measurements. Gross ecosystem production (GEP) was determined as the residual in the carbon balance by subtracting modeled respiration values from measured NEE.
