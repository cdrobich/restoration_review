Water table was monitored using a grid of 12 groundwater monitoring wells to assess the hydrologic conditions accurately.
Revegetation Techniques Tested: Seeding: Eight species were planted; germination and survival rates were monitored. Seedling Transplants: Carex aquatilis seedlings were grown and transplanted into the study plots. Rhizome Transplants: Rhizomes from six species were collected and transplanted to evaluate survival patterns across different water table conditions. Willow Stem Cuttings: Cuttings from four willow species were planted to study their survival in relation to the water table depth.
Statistical Analysis: Logistic Regression Analysis: Used to analyze the impact of water table depth on the survival of planted seedlings, rhizomes, and stem cuttings. Different polynomial models were tested to fit the survival data optimally. Chi-square goodness-of-fit and model deviance were used to select the best fitting model. Survival rate analysis were calculated for various plantings from 1992 through 1994, focusing on seasonal variations and water table impacts.","","Abiotic","",NA,1,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"1",""

These locations represented different stages of estuarine habitat restoration and were chosen to compare the effects of restoration on juvenile Chinook salmon.
Data Collection and Analysis: Aerial imagery, LiDAR, and channel morphology measurements were used to assess the post-restoration habitat accessibility and morphometry. Continuous data from data loggers provided water temperature and level readings.
Energetic Input: Data from 2010–2012 on invertebrate prey densities were used to estimate the energetic input in the restored habitats. Prey density was converted to energy density using values from the literature.
Invertebrate Prey Consumption: Diet samples from juvenile Chinook salmon were analyzed to assess food resource utilization. Fish were captured using fyke traps during specific tidal conditions, and their stomach contents were examined for various prey taxa.
Juvenile Chinook Resource Use and Body Condition: Measurements included length, weight, and stomach content mass. Body condition was evaluated using Fulton’s condition factor, and otolith analysis was used to assess growth rates and residence times.
Statistical Analysis: Generalized linear models evaluated relationships between body condition metrics (e.g., weight, Fulton’s condition factor) and environmental variables like site characteristics, prey biomass, and salmon density.

Restoration of six plots began in 2008, involving cutting F. alnus and treating cut stumps with herbicide, followed by burning brush piles. Invasive plants were managed in 2008 and 2009 using herbicides, cutting, and flame treatments.
Experimental Design: The study created two treatments: invaded (control with unmanaged glossy buckthorn) and restored (glossy buckthorn removed and invasives managed). Uninvaded reference plots were also delineated.
Nine 1 m^2 sampling quadrats were established in each plot.
Sampling: Soil characteristics were measured from soil cores collected in October 2007, September 2008, and September 2009. Plant community, light availability, and microhabitat parameters were measured in all quadrats in September 2007, 2008, and 2009. Statistical Analysis: Standardization of cover types and transformations of variables were performed for ANOVA analyses. ANOVA was used to examine treatment, time, and interaction effects. Nonmetric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) was used to examine shifts in characteristics over time, followed by analysis of similarity (ANOSIM) for comparisons.","","Abiotic","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,1,NA,NA,NA,1,NA,1,1,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",""

Restoration Methods: MSPs were applied to seismic lines to facilitate tree regeneration. Plantings reflected species present in adjacent forests. Seismic lines were mounded every 6 meters, with planting densities of around 1,300 stems per hectare. Mounding was accomplished using a 20 tonne construction excavator with a bucket attachment. Site preparation was completed by excavating and inverting material, forming a mound of mineral and organic soil and an adjacent depression. Equipment operators were instructed to make mounds that were 0.75 m in width, 1 m in length, and 0.80 m in height, allowing for settling, which was expected to occur with mounded organics. Three mounds were placed across the width of the seismic line, in a diamond or checkered pattern, regardless of the seismic line width.                     Sampling and Field Methods: Sample sites were selected based on specific criteria to avoid pseudo replication. Each site consisted of paired plots: one on the seismic line and one in the adjacent forest (reference). Tree regeneration and forest stand conditions were measured along 30-meter transects.
Regeneration Density Analysis: Generalized linear mixed effects models were used to analyze tree regeneration density in relation to restoration area, treatment, plot location, and stand characteristics. Separate analyses were conducted for each ecosite due to their influence on regeneration patterns.
Regeneration Patterns Based on Seismic Line Characteristics: Regeneration density was analyzed with respect to seismic line characteristics such as orientation, width, stand conditions, and ground cover.

Sites varied in their characteristics, including vegetation cover, peat accumulation, and restoration status. Two sites were in a small peatland surrounded by harvested areas, with dense shrub and Sphagnum moss cover. Some sites were actively vacuum-harvested and devoid of vegetation, while others were restored by raising the water table and applying plant material containing Sphagnum diaspores and mulch. Sites harvested with block-cutting techniques and abandoned for over 30 years showed varied vegetation, from sparse cover of birch trees to dense patches of cotton-grass. Some areas were naturally vegetated after block-cutting, with ridges having small trees and shrubs and trenches having dense mosses, sedges, and shrubs.
Peat Sample Collection and Preparation: In September 1999, triplicate cores were collected from each site, down to 1 m or at least 10 cm below the water table. Surface vegetation was removed, and samples were divided into 10 cm depth segments, ensuring separation of peat above and below the water table. Samples were stored in sealed plastic bags on ice to minimize oxygen exposure, especially for samples collected beneath the water table. Laboratory incubations focused on peat from the top 10 cm or just below living vegetation and from the 10 cm above and below the water table, with adjustments for sites where the water table was at or near the surface. Roots were removed, and samples were homogenized by hand.
Laboratory Analyses: Peat decomposition was assessed using the von Post measure, with values ranging from 1 (no decomposition) to 10 (complete humification). Aerobic and anaerobic incubations were conducted to determine CO2 and CH4 production and oxidation potentials. Aerobic incubations involved placing peat and distilled water in sealed flasks, sampled daily for four days to measure CO2 production potential. Anaerobic incubations required evacuation of flasks with a vacuum pump and flushing with O2-free N2, sampled over 30 days to measure CH4 and CO2 production. Gas analysis was conducted using gas chromatographs equipped with flame ionization detectors, with concentrations determined relative to standards and rates calculated based on changes in headspace concentrations over time.","Says one natural bog and two cut-over peatlands - picked peatlands for wetland class, also says restoration 2, 4 and 30 years prior to sampling, sampling was in 1999 ","Abiotic","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,1,1,"",""

Wetlands were within larger state-protected natural areas, while restored wetlands were on privately held lands under wetland protection easements.
Sampling: Natural wetlands were sampled based on dominance by Carex or Phalaris, while restored wetlands were dominated by Phalaris. Elevation differences were measured using a Topcon GRS-1 to assess microtopographic heterogeneity.
Soil Sample Collection: Soil samples were collected from both natural and restored wetlands in 2012 and 2013, with additional sites added in 2013. Samples were collected from areas dominated by Carex and Phalaris in natural wetlands, and from Phalaris-dominated areas in restored wetlands. Six 1-m^2 plots were established in each community type at each site. Soil cores were collected from high and low microtopographic points, composited, and analyzed for denitrification potential, soil moisture, and nutrient concentrations.
Denitrification Potential: Denitrification potential was measured using the denitrification enzyme activity assay (DEA) incubation method. Soil samples were amended with a DEA solution to remove resource limitations and inhibit bacterial reproduction. Gas samples were collected at intervals over 180 minutes and analyzed using a Gas Chromatograph.

Descriptions of each site: 
Dennis Township Salt Hay Farm:  Diked in the 1950s and farmed for salt hay until 1995 when acquired by estuary enhancement program. Minor breaches in perimeter dikes resulted in flooding before acquisition. Restoration plan included creation of six new inlets and associated channels to allow tidal inundation. Restoration construction completed in August 1996, followed by normal daily tidal inundation and drainage.
Maurice River Township Salt Hay Farm: Historically, perimeter dikes were installed to eliminate normal tidal inundation. Breaches in perimeter dikes in 1992 led to uncontrolled flooding, causing loss of vegetative cover. Restoration plan involved creating four new or enlarged inlets and associated channels. Restoration construction completed in early 1998, followed by normal daily tidal inundation and drainage.
Commercial Township Salt Hay Farm: Used for salt hay farming for three generations until storms in 1996 caused breaches in perimeter dikes.
Breaches led to permanent flooding of most areas during the growing season of 1996. Restoration plan included creating 10 inlets and associated channel systems. Construction completed in fall 1997, followed by normal daily tidal inundation and drainage.
Moores Beach-West Reference Marsh: Former salt hay farm that restored naturally after storm damage to perimeter dikes in 1972. By 1992, most of the area had converted to low marsh dominated by S. alterniflora. No improvements made to inlets or channel systems for tidal inundation and drainage. Marsh area designated as reference site encompasses approximately 550 hectares.Mapping Methods: Vegetation mapping of the wetland restoration sites and the reference marshes has been conducted annually since 1995. Aerial photography was acquired during the peak growing season each year at a nominal scale of 1:9600 (1 cm = 60 m). The digital orthophotographs produced from the processed images were used to create digital maps of vegetation coverage. Cover types, including Spartina-dominated marsh vegetation, Phragmites-dominated areas, non-vegetated marsh plains, internal water, channels, and upland/developed land, were identified and mapped using AutoCAD software.","","Vegetation","",NA,NA,1,1,1,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",""

Descriptions of each site: The Braun and Barnstable natural wetlands were each approximately 4 hectares in area, while the Barnstable natural wetland was about 2 hectares. The restored wetlands ranged from approximately 0.4 hectares to 4 hectares. These restored wetlands were restored in 1986 and 1992 to provide wildlife habitat and improve water quality. They were restored to a hydrology similar to depressional wetlands, characterized by high water levels in winter and a growing season drawdown. The upland grass strips served as buffers between fertilized agricultural fields and the wetlands. Sampling: Soil cores were collected from each site in July and August 1997 for analysis of various soil characteristics, including pH, texture, moisture content, bulk density, organic matter content, and phosphorus fractions. Analysis: Soil P fractions were characterized using a sequential extraction procedure to identify nine inorganic and organic soil P fractions. Phosphorus sorption capacity was estimated, and soil Al, Fe, and Ca concentrations were determined. Statistical analyses were conducted to compare landforms within each study site and across all study sites.","","Abiotic","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,1,1,1,NA,NA,1,NA,1,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","molar ratios "

GIS Analysis: Modern orthophotos were used for manual digitization of tidal marsh features in a GIS. Tidal channel margins and shorelines were digitized to analyze marsh characteristics and changes over time. Channel geometry, island area, perimeter, and other metrics were calculated using GIS tools.
Allometric and Statistical Analysis: Allometric relationships between marsh island area and channel geometry were explored using log-transformed linear regression analysis. ANCOVA was used to compare regression slopes among study sites. Residual analysis was conducted to compare dike breach sites with reference marshes, assessing deviations from regression relationships. Two-way ANOVA was employed to analyze differences in dike breach site residuals compared to reference sites, considering delta location and treatment.

Wetlands were reflooded a year prior to the study, and adjacent upland areas were seeded with a prairie seed mix devoid of wetland species. For comparison, natural wetlands of similar size, soil type, and hydrology were selected.
Sampling: Vegetation surveys were conducted to assess on-site vegetation, seed rain, and seed bank patterns. Cover classes were assigned to plant species based on their total cover within each vegetation zone, and voucher specimens were collected for species with a cover class of 5% or greater. Seed rain was evaluated using seed traps placed along transects within the periphery of restored and natural wetlands. Seed traps were collected every six weeks during the growing seasons of 2002 and 2003. Seeds were identified, tallied, and categorized as primary or secondary dispersal events. 
Seed Bank Assay in Restored Wetlands: A seed bank assay was conducted in restored wetlands to assess the presence of remnant seed banks of native hydrophytic perennials. Soil cores were taken from multiple locations across each restored site and subjected to germination trials under greenhouse conditions.
Statistical Analysis: The average annual seed rain per wetland type was determined, and a one-way ANOVA was used to compare seed rain between restored and natural wetlands. Primary seed dispersal rates between restored and natural wetlands were also compared. Sorenson's Similarity Coefficient was used to evaluate the similarity between seed rain and on-site vegetation. Additionally, the species present in the seed bank samples from restored wetlands were compiled for further analysis.

Land use in these watersheds is primarily agricultural and forested, with increasing commercial and residential development. The study site comprises a restored marsh and a natural marsh. The restored marsh was formerly drained for agricultural purposes and restored to capture sediments during increased flow periods and provide waterfowl habitat. The natural marsh has undergone some channel modifications and historical sedimentation.
Water Quality Monitoring: Continuous-record stream flow and water quality gauging stations were installed at various locations in Halfway Creek and Sand Lake Coulee Creek. Water samples were collected at regular intervals for analysis of nutrients (e.g., nitrogen and phosphorus) and sediment concentrations. Storm-event samples were automatically collected using refrigerated samplers triggered by stage changes. Samples were analyzed for various parameters, including total nitrogen, total phosphorus, ammonia, nitrate, and suspended sediment concentrations.
Load Estimation: Nutrient and sediment concentration data, along with stream discharge, were used to compute daily loads. The Graphical Constituent Loading Analysis System (GCLAS) was employed for load calculations.
Yearly loads were estimated by summing daily loads.
Retention of nutrients and sediment by the marsh complex was calculated as the difference between inputs and outputs.
Soil Characteristics and Marsh Complex: Denitrification and nitrification rates were measured using sediment cores collected from various locations within the marsh complex. Experiments were conducted to determine factors limiting denitrification rates. Soil excavation was performed in the restored marsh, and soil cores were analyzed for carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus content.
Statistical Analysis: Data were analyzed for normality and homogeneity of variances. One-way and two-way ANOVAs were conducted to assess differences in denitrification and nitrification rates among sampling locations and periods. Tukey's method was used to test for significant differences among treatment means.

The lake, along with Agency Lake to the north, comprises approximately 232 km² with a mean depth of about 2.8 meters. Historically, the region contained numerous wetlands, but approximately 90% have been drained for agricultural purposes over the past century.

The water quality of Upper Klamath Lake has degraded due to increased nutrient loads and sedimentation rates since the mid-20th century, leading to hypereutrophic conditions characterized by massive cyanobacterial blooms, particularly dominated by Aphanizomenon flos-aquae. These blooms, occurring from mid- to late June, result in the formation of buoyant layers over the lake surface. As these blooms decline, oxygen depletion in the water column and lakebed may occur, negatively impacting the survival of endangered fish species like shortnose suckers and Lost River suckers.

On October 30, 2007, engineered levee breaches reintroduced approximately 11 km² of historic wetland to the lake and Williamson River, after being used for crop production for several decades. Three lake sites and three wetland sites were sampled between November 1, 2007, and August 11, 2010, before and after the annual cyanobacterial bloom peak.

The lake sites include a mid-lake site (MDN), a site within the Williamson River plume (WMR), and a site off Modoc Rim (MRM). The wetland sites include one in the Upper Klamath National Wildlife Refuge (WET) and two hydrologically reconnected wetlands near levee breaches (TNC1 and TNC2). The residence time of water varies seasonally in the lake, ranging from approximately 50 days during high-runoff periods to 300 days during low-runoff periods.

Sampling involved deploying nonmetallic porewater profilers to collect samples from six depths to characterize dissolved-solute vertical gradients. Water-column profiles and sediment samples were also collected. Dissolved-solute analyses included trace-element samples analyzed by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) and macronutrient samples determined by spectrophotometry.

Initially a bog, the extracted area exposed peat layers typical of a poor fen after extraction. Restoration efforts commenced in 2008 and concluded in 2009 with the aim of fostering favorable conditions for moss layer development and the recovery of the carbon sink function. Restoration activities involved altering the peatland's hydrology by blocking drainage ditches and constructing dykes to retain snowmelt and elevate the water table. Additionally, moss diaspores harvested from a nearby moderate-rich riverine fen were applied to the restored area at a ratio of 1:10 (1 ha of collected material over 10 ha of restored area), followed by the application of straw mulch.
Sampling: six sampling plots were established in the restored area, arranged in three pairs along the gradient of hydrological conditions. Another set of six plots was established in the nearby undisturbed peatland, with three plots on hummocks and three on hollows. Additionally, four plots with bare peat were monitored at the restored site to assess the effects of vegetation cover on carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4) fluxes.

Muddy Creek marsh had been degraded due to tidal restrictions caused by the construction of a road and culvert system in the early 1900s. Restoration efforts took place in the winter/spring of 2016, involving the replacement of the culvert with a spanning bridge, thereby allowing for the return of nearly full tidal flooding to the degraded marsh. The three reference marshes, on the other hand, were never degraded due to tidal restrictions and were dominated by the native salt marsh grass S. alterniflora.
Sampling:  Sample collection and processing occurred before and after restoration in the degraded marsh and were compared to samples collected from reference marshes. Sampling was conducted in June, August, and October of 2015, before the restoration, and in June, July, August, and October after the restoration, spanning from 2016 to 2017. The first sampling after restoration construction was completed occurred just three months after the restoration. Multiple sites were selected within each habitat type in Muddy Creek marsh and the reference marshes.
Analysis: Various analyses were performed on the collected samples, including nucleic acid extraction and sequence preparation, linear mixed model regression to identify abiotic changes due to restoration, analysis of prokaryotic and fungal community composition, diversity analysis, network analysis, and correlation analysis between community composition and environmental variables. Statistical analysis: linear Mixed Model Regression was used to identify abiotic changes resulting from restoration. It involved fitting a linear mixed-effects model where the environmental parameter served as the response variable, while habitat and year were treated as fixed effects. Sampling site within the marsh and sampling date within the year were considered random effects to account for potential variability within and between sites over time.
Network Analysis: Network analysis was conducted to explore the relationships between different microbial communities sampled from both restored and reference marshes. This involved constructing networks where nodes represented individual samples and edges represented correlations in the abundance of shared prokaryotes or fungi between samples. The analysis aimed to identify modules or clusters of samples that were more interconnected with each other than with samples outside the module. Monte Carlo simulations were used to assess the significance of the observed modularity. Additionally, the network analysis helped in determining the influence of habitat, location (restored vs. reference marshes), and time (sampling year) on microbial community composition. Eigen centrality scores were computed for nodes in the network to identify nodes that were highly connected, indicating their importance in the network structure.
Alpha and Beta Diversity Analysis: Alpha diversity refers to the diversity within individual microbial communities, while beta diversity refers to the diversity between different microbial communities. Alpha diversity was calculated using Shannon diversity index, and differences among restored and reference marshes were tested using linear models or mixed-effects models. Beta diversity was assessed using Bray-Curtis dissimilarities and visualized through principal coordinate analysis (PCoA). Permutational multivariate analysis of variance (PERMANOVA) was conducted to test for significant differences in community composition between restored and reference marshes. Random Forest Modeling:Random forest modeling was employed to determine the most important taxa within sediment samples of each habitat in classifying prokaryotic and fungal communities before and after restoration. This involved building classification models to classify samples based on their restoration status (pre vs. post) using the relative abundances of microbial taxa as features.
The importance of each microbial taxon in classifying the samples was assessed using the GINI index, and the top discriminatory features (ASVs) were visualized.","complicated methodology, not sure I completely understood it all may want to check outcomes ","Microbial","",1,NA,1,1,NA,1,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",""

Different sites were chosen based on disturbance history categorized as upper and lower sites.  Lower Bay Sites: Saints Rest Marsh near Saint John, New Brunswick: This site is compared to a reference marsh at Dipper Harbour, located 28 km southwest. Saints Rest Marsh is undergoing recovery. Dipper Harbour: This serves as the reference marsh for comparison with Saints Rest Marsh. Upper Bay Sites: John Lusby Wildlife Sanctuary: This marsh is located on the Nova Scotia coast of the Cumberland Basin and is compared to a reference site, Allen Creek Marsh (also known as Wood Point), located on the opposite shore of the Basin. Allen Creek Marsh (Wood Point): This site serves as the reference marsh for comparison with John Lusby Wildlife Sanctuary.
Since John Lusby Wildlife Sanctuary is considerably larger than the other sites, two subset study areas were chosen for analysis, representative of the variability in the channel network and comparable in size to the area studied at Saints Rest Marsh.
Channel Network and Pool Mapping: Channels, pools, and their elevations were mapped through on-site surveying at each location, covering specific areas of each marsh between 2004 and 2005. 
Various data points were collected using a Carrier Phase Trimble 4700 Differential Global Positioning System. Channels were surveyed based on depth and observed connections to other channels, with a focus on functioning channels capable of carrying both flood and ebb waters. Pools were mapped within specific areas of each marsh, defined as features containing water most of the year with no emergent vascular plants. The length of channel networks, sinuosity, and pool distribution were analyzed using GIS software and spatial pattern analysis packages.
Pre-abandonment channel networks exclusive of agricultural ditches at Saints Rest Marsh were digitized from scanned vertical aerial photographs taken in 1950 and 1958 to compare with present-day networks. Buffers and proximity analyses were conducted to examine the proximity of marsh surfaces to channels and pools.","","Abiotic","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"1","marsh length, area and channel density "

Cores collected at a depth of 8.5 cm. Only the 0- to 5-cm samples analyzed. Soil samples collected over 2 days in late August, processed within 48 hours. Surface water collected and filtered through 0.20-µm mesh for denitrification assays.
Summary of Analyses: Field-moist soils analyzed for soil moisture content, plant-available N (NO3-N, NH4-N), and denitrification.
Unamended denitrification measured using the acetylene-inhibition method. Denitrification rates determined by regressing N2O concentrations against time. Bulk density, organic C, and total N determined from dried, ground, and sieved soils.
Variograms generated to evaluate spatial structure. Global Moran’s I calculated to test for spatial autocorrelation. Getis–Ord Gi* test used to detect hot spots of denitrification.","","Abiotic","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,1,NA,1,NA,NA,1,NA,1,1,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",""

complex, the Cottonwood Lake Study Area (16 wetlands sampled), and three restored wetland complexes, Nest Wildlife Development Area (14 wetlands sampled), Sweet Grass Wildlife Development Area (11 wetlands sampled), and Pilgrim’s Rest Wildlife Development Area (12 wetlands sampled). Human activities, such as cultivation and drainage for agriculture, have significantly impacted wetland ecosystems, leading to changes in plant species composition and hydrologic regimes. Restoration efforts have been undertaken to mitigate the impacts of wetland drainage, but studies indicate differences in plant species composition and wetland volume between restored and natural wetlands.
Sampling Methods: In July and August of 1995 plant communities in wetlands were sampled in various complexes, including Cottonwood Lake, Hawk’s Nest, Sweet Grass, and Pilgrim’s Rest. Transects radiating from wetland centers were established, and 0.25 m2 plots were randomly located within each wetland vegetation zone. Both native and non-native plant species were identified, and the quality of native plant communities was assessed using various indices, including C¯ and FQI.
Data Analysis: C¯ and FQI values were calculated for each wetland using panel-assigned and data-generated C values based on plant species occurrences in sampled wetlands. Species richness and the percentage of native species were also calculated for each wetland complex.
Plant Species Classification: Native species occurring only in undisturbed native prairie wetlands were considered conservative and assigned higher C values, while those occurring in disturbed wetlands were assigned lower C values based on their frequency of occurrence.","","Vegetation","",NA,NA,1,1,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",""

Snowmelt DOC fluxes were estimated using snow water equivalents. Spatial and Temporal Controls of FCH4 and Spectral Decomposition: Methane fluxes (FCH4) were decomposed into low-frequency and high-frequency components using singular spectrum analysis to identify seasonal and instantaneous effects. Linear regression models were used to analyze the influence of environmental variables on methane fluxes.
NEE Partitioning: Net ecosystem exchange (NEE) was partitioned into gross primary productivity (GPP) and ecosystem respiration (ER) using established methods based on environmental variables and gas exchange measurements. Vegetation Survey: A non-destructive vegetation survey was conducted to assess the percentage cover of vascular and non-vascular plants on restored peat fields and drainage ditches. Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI): Landsat EVI data were used to characterize vegetation recovery following restoration efforts by extracting EVI values for the study sites.","","Vegetation","",NA,NA,NA,1,1,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",""

Baraboo River Floodplain (restored); originally supported row crop agriculture for at least 50 years before being restored in 2002-2003 by the United States Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS).
Restoration Efforts: Drainage structures were removed, and a water control gate was installed to allow flooding of the site during high flow periods and maintain water levels on the floodplain as the river recedes.
Sampling: occurred simultaneously at both sites on 12 September 2004 to control for temporal variability. A cyclic sampling design was employed to optimize the placement of sampling points, enhancing sampling efficiency by reducing oversampling at small lag distances. Within each site, a nested design was used, with small plots nested within larger plots, allowing for pattern detection at coarse and fine spatial scales. Sampling locations were established in a grid pattern, with transects at 5 m intervals oriented to cardinal directions, creating a grid of potential sampling locations. A 7×7×3 cycle was applied to determine which intersections of the grid were sampled, resulting in a total of 80 flagged locations. A second, smaller grid was laid out within the large plot, and a 7×7×2 cycle was applied to determine sampling locations within this smaller grid, resulting in 36 sampled locations. This sampling protocol allowed for the measurement of lag distances ranging from 35 cm to 350 cm in the small plot and 5 m to 81 m in the large plot.
Soil Analyses: At each marked grid location, a uniformly sized soil sample was collected using a corer to obtain a cylindrical core with dimensions of 8 cm diameter and 12 cm depth. Surface material and vegetation were removed prior to sampling, and samples were sealed in polyethylene bags, refrigerated, and homogenized overnight prior to analysis. Denitrification rates were measured using the acetylene block method with nutrient amendments and forced anoxia to simulate ideal denitrification conditions. Soil samples were amended with organic carbon, nitrate, and chloramphenicol to inhibit de novo enzyme synthesis during the assay period. After incubation, gas samples were collected to measure nitrous oxide (N2O) production rates, which were then used to calculate denitrification rates. Soil samples were weighed, dried, and reweighed to determine soil moisture content. Soil organic matter (OM) was determined by loss on ignition, and total nitrogen (TN) was measured after digestion.
Nitrate concentrations were determined using a KCl extraction method, and concentrations were converted to ?g per g dry soil using site-specific regressions.
Statistical Analysis: Basic descriptive statistics were used to characterize soils among sites and plots, and coefficients of variation (CV) were calculated as a measure of within-plot variability. Mixed model approaches were used to investigate relationships between denitrification and other soil properties at each site, correcting for spatial autocorrelation. Semi-variograms were used to assess spatial variability and pattern in denitrification, OM, TN, nitrate, and moisture for both large and small plots at each site. Omnidirectional semi-variograms were calculated using a robust estimator and standardized to allow for comparisons between sites. Fitted models (spherical, Gaussian, exponential) were used to develop spatial estimates of variable distributions within the study plots.","wetland called floodplain, coded as shallow open water?","Abiotic","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,1,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,1,1,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",""

Bois-des-Bel peatland is a treed bog, with 11.5 ha drained in 1972 and vacuum harvested from 1973 to 1980 before abandonment. Restoration began in the fall of 1999, involving measures such as surface tilling, partial filling of drainage ditches with surface debris, construction of bunds along topographic contours, and spreading of Sphagnum diaspores followed by straw mulch.
Field Measurements: Pre-restoration measurements were taken between May and October 1999. Continuous half-hourly fluxes of CO2 and evapotranspiration were measured at the restored site 1.5 m above the peat surface using the eddy covariance technique from May 17 to October 11 in 2000 and 2001.
Instruments included a 3-D sonic anemometer-thermometer (Campbell Scientific CSAT 3) and an open-path infrared gas analyzer (IRGA) (Li7500, LI-COR Inc.).
Quality-controlled eddy covariance measurements had an error of approximately 20% prior to correction. Respiration was separated from tower net ecosystem CO2 exchange (NEE) measurements using ensemble averages of quality nighttime tower measurements. Respiration was modeled as a function of soil temperature at a depth of 5 cm. Gross ecosystem production (GEP) was determined as the residual in the carbon balance by subtracting modeled respiration values from measured NEE.

The study compared nine restored wetlands, which were drained in the 1970s and restored in the 1990s, to nine natural (i.e., never drained) wetlands. 
Sampling: Vegetation composition was recorded as percent cover in three visually determined concentric wetland vegetation zones (Center, Inner-Typha, and Typha zones) using Daubenmire canopy cover estimates. Substrate samples were collected, sieved, and analyzed to characterize the seed banks. Two methods were used: directly counting the seeds present in a volume of substrate and identifying and counting the seedlings that germinated from these samples under controlled conditions. The germination assays were conducted under controlled laboratory settings designed to replicate natural hydrological conditions, with samples exposed to alternating dark/light photoperiods and temperature fluctuations to simulate the growing season in the PPR. Statistical analysis: PCA was conducted to explore the relationships among the wetlands based on vegetation cover, seed bank abundance, and seedling abundance. The analysis aimed to identify patterns and groupings among the restored and natural wetlands, highlighting differences in floristic composition. Richness, Simpson's Index of Diversity, and Evenness were calculated to compare the biodiversity of seed banks and seedling assemblages between restored and natural wetlands. Two-tailed t-tests (assuming unequal variances) and Mann-Whitney U-tests were used to assess whether differences in means between restored and natural wetlands were statistically significant.

The drainage of tidal wetlands leads to land subsidence, exacerbated by sea-level rise, resulting in the loss of marsh habitats. The study focused on breached-levee sites, comparing them with natural marshes to evaluate rates of marsh surface sedimentation and elevation change. Three regions of the delta with different sediment supply and tidal energy regimes were selected for the study.
Sampling: measuring sedimentation on the marsh surface through vertical accretion using white feldspar markers and cryogenic coring. Sediment-erosion tables (SET) were used to integrate processes affecting marsh surface elevation over the upper substrate. Additional cryogenic cores were taken to determine bulk density and organic/inorganic composition. Temporary boardwalks were installed during site visits to prevent surface disturbance. Baseline measurements were taken in March 1998, with subsequent measurements at seasonal intervals through June 1999, and a follow-up measurement in August 2000.","","Abiotic","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,1,1,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,1,1,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",""

The sites were classified into different treatments, including cranberry farms, young retired sites, old retired sites, flooded sites, restored sites, and natural sites. These treatments varied in terms of their history and management practices.
Cranberry farms (3 sites): These sites were actively farmed and served as a reference for comparison with other treatments. Young retired sites (5 sites): These sites were recently retired from cranberry farming, ranging from 1 to 4 years since retirement. Old retired sites (3 sites): These sites were retired from cranberry farming 17 to 20 years prior to sampling. Flooded sites (3 sites): These sites were artificially flooded as part of the Wetlands Reserve Program, creating artificial wetlands using existing water control structures. Restored sites (6 sites): These sites underwent ecological restoration following a methodology developed by the Massachusetts Department of Environmental Restoration. Natural sites (3 sites): These sites had no history of cranberry farming and served as natural reference sites.
The restoration process involved removing dams and water control structures, plugging irrigation ditches, and reconstructing channels and floodplains. No seeding was performed at restored or flooded sites, as native plants were expected to recolonize naturally from the belowground seedbank.
Sampling: Soil samples were collected at each site, spaced 30 m apart, and analyzed for various physicochemical properties, including macro and micronutrient concentrations, cation exchange capacity, base saturation, and soil organic matter. Denitrification potential and methane emissions were also measured. DNA sequencing was conducted to analyze microbial communities in the soil samples. Prokaryotic amplicons were obtained by amplifying the V4-V5 region of the 16S rRNA gene, while eukaryotic amplicons were obtained by amplifying the V9 region of the 18S rRNA gene. Bioinformatics analysis was performed using QIIME2. Statistical analysis: To understand spatial relationships, the Euclidean distance matrix of GPS coordinates was compared against soil variables and microbial community composition. No significant relationship between geography and soil variables was found, but there was some spatial autocorrelation for microeukaryotes. Community Similarity Analysis: Weighted UniFrac distance measures were used to assess microbial community similarity to natural sites. Linear mixed-effects models were applied to analyze community similarity scores across different treatments, accounting for site replication.
Constrained Ordination Analysis: Canonical analysis of principal coordinates (CAP) was used to visualize community differences and identify soil variables related to microbial community composition. Redundant and non-contributing variables were removed to achieve the most explanatory power with the fewest variables. Differential Heat Trees: Differential heat trees were constructed to visualize differences in within-sample dominance of prokaryotic and microeukaryotic taxa. The log2 median ratio was used to compare differential abundance between treatments, with significant differences highlighted.","","Abiotic","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,1,1,NA,1,NA,1,NA,1,1,"",NA,NA,NA,1,NA,"",""

Historically, this area was a deltaic wetland connected to Bear Creek, but in the early 1900s, an earthen berm was built, separating the wetland from Bear Creek, and the wetland was drained for celery production. Restoration activities began in 2002, ceasing agricultural use and allowing the wetland to be re-inundated. The study focused on the West Pond within BLWRA, which had not undergone sediment dredging before 2016. The restoration aimed to create wildlife habitat and potentially restore natural nutrient retention processes. The West Pond was selected for study due to its expected substantial water exchange with Bear Creek upon hydrologic reconnection. Additional restoration activities, completed after the study, included dewatering the pond, dredging nutrient-rich sediments, re-inundating the pond, and removing the berm to reconnect the wetland with Bear Creek.
Sampling: intact sediment cores were collected from the northwest side of the West Pond in August 2014. These cores were divided into three treatment groups: Control (simulating conditions without restoration), HR (simulating hydrologic reconnection to Bear Creek), and HR + D (simulating hydrologic reconnection and sediment dredging). Water from the West Pond and Bear Creek was added to the cores to mimic respective conditions. The cores underwent pre-incubation to stabilize conditions, followed by the addition of 15N–NO3 ? to the overlying water to trace nitrogen dynamics. Cores were sacrificed at intervals, and samples were collected for dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN) analysis, dissolved N2 and N2O analysis, and determination of ?15N2 and ?15N2O. Statistical analysis: Two-way interaction effects ANOVA: Differences in denitrification, N2O production, and NH4+ flux among restoration scenarios and incubation durations were analyzed using two-way interaction effects ANOVA.  Bayesian Framework with Markov-chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) Iterations: Statistical models and posterior distributions were analyzed using a Bayesian framework with R and JAGS. MCMC iterations were run on three chains after a burn-in period, and credible intervals were constructed around the mean of each group. Probability Estimation: The probability of a significant difference between groups was determined by calculating the proportion of iterations in which the posterior estimate of one group was smaller than another. A significant difference was considered when less than 5% of the posterior estimates were smaller than those of another group. Scenario Modeling: Scenarios were modeled to estimate possible changes in NO3? and NH4+ load to Bear Lake resulting from reconnecting the wetland to Bear Creek. These models incorporated parameters such as denitrification rates, wetland area, stream NO3? concentration, stream discharge, and the fraction of Bear Creek water entering the wetland. Comparison of Observed and Modeled Data: The results of the statistical analysis were compared with observed data from the wetlands to evaluate the accuracy of the models and assess potential impacts on nutrient cycling.","","Abiotic","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,1,"",NA,NA,NA,1,NA,"",""

Restored wetlands less than 5 years old or inaccessible were excluded from the study. Sampling: occurred during specific periods in 2017 and 2018, comparing restored properties with reference sites known for high-quality habitat and untreated sites within the GHRA. The evaluation utilized biotic indices for plants and macroinvertebrates developed by the Wisconsin DNR, alongside water quality, soil, and hydrological measurements. Plant sampling was conducted via a timed-meander protocol to capture peak floristic diversity, and macroinvertebrates were sampled using a D-shaped net across different water column depths. Environmental variables, including pH, conductivity, temperature, and dissolved oxygen, were measured using a multiprobe meter. Land-use patterns around each property were assessed using the WISCLAND 2 dataset, analyzing proportions of urban, agricultural, forest, wetland, grassland, and open water areas within a 2 km radius. Historical land-use influences and remnant communities were also considered by examining early 20th-century vegetative community maps.
Statistical analysis: Floristic quality was calculated using a calculator that considered species' coefficients of conservatism and percent cover, generating a weighted mean C-value (wCa) to assess wetland quality.

Bic-St.-Fabien (BSF), Québec: Manual block-cut since 1946, vacuum harvesting until 2000. Bunds created for water retention; donor material from a nearby fen spread, and the area covered with straw. Pre- and post-restoration flux measurements taken.
Pointe-Lebel (PLB), Québec: Vacuum harvesting started in the 1970s. Standard MLTT protocols with blocked but open ditches. The area adjacent to the restored site, lacking spontaneous vegetation, served as an unrestored comparison.
Seba Beach (SEB), Alberta: Approximately 30 ha restored section. Ditches infilled; donor material from a treed ombrotrophic bog. Higher straw application than recommended in some areas; no fertilization. Both restored and unrestored areas, as well as a natural peatland, were measured.

Measurements accounted for ecosystem respiration (ER), net ecosystem exchange (NEE), and gross ecosystem photosynthesis (GEP). Fluxes were measured regularly across the growing season, ensuring at least monthly data collection from May to August.
Environmental Monitoring: Water table position and soil temperature profiles were recorded at each flux measurement. Vegetation cover within each plot was estimated visually, identifying mosses, forbs, graminoids, shrubs, and trees.
Statistical Analysis: linear mixed effects (LME) models were used, with site as a random factor, to analyze the data while accounting for the non-uniform distribution of plots within and across sites.

Oil discovery and subsequent development initiated in the 1960s have led to both direct and indirect impacts on the environment, including habitat disturbances necessitating revegetation.
Disturbances Leading to Revegetation Needs:
Gravel Pad Construction: Implemented by piling gravel over tundra to create a stable surface for roads and infrastructure, while insulating the ground to limit permafrost thawing.
Overburden Placement: Involves the displacement of sand, gravel, and silt during the excavation of gravel mines and reserve pits, leading to the need for revegetation of stockpiled areas.
Ice Pad Construction: Utilizes ice platforms for drilling activities, with long-term use leading to significant vegetation disturbance.
Peat Stockpiling and Construction: Disturbance from peat road construction and the digging of pits necessitates revegetation efforts.
Revegetation Approaches: Sites have been subject to seeding and fertilization, using both imported cultivars and locally gathered native plant mixes, tailored to the Arctic environment. The selection of seed mixes and fertilization techniques varies based on contractor judgment and seed availability. Techniques also include surface manipulation to counteract compaction and encourage moisture retention.
Examples of Performance Standards: A review of permit performance standards for revegetation on the North Slope emphasized percent cover requirements and the implementation period for achieving these standards. The standards apply to gravel pads, overburden, and ice pads, with a focus on achieving a certain vegetation cover relative to reference sites.
Data Sources and Analysis: The study included revegetating and reference sites, with data collected through various methods, including walking point method and quadrat visual estimates. Data were standardized for maximum percent cover, and plant species were grouped to mitigate identification errors. Analysis aimed to compare vegetation cover between natural and disturbed sites, develop predictive models of vegetation cover over time, and assess plant community composition.Plots and models examined total percent cover data without differentiating by plant community composition initially. A nonmetric multidimensional scaling (NMS) analysis was used to search for patterns that separated revegetating sites and natural reference sites based on community composition.","ordination, 2000 ","Vegetation","",1,NA,1,1,1,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",""

Sampling: Insects were sampled from June 1 to July 29, 2006. Various trapping methods were utilized to capture a broad range of insect taxa, reflecting different behaviors and ecological niches. These methods included sweeping vegetation with a net, using yellow pan traps for attracting and capturing flying and ground-walking insects, and employing Malaise traps for intercepting insects in flight. The sampling was done regularly, and insects were preserved, dried, mounted, and identified, with a focus on Brachycera flies, excluding certain difficult-to-identify families. The study also assessed functional diversity based on insect size and trophic groups, drawing on extensive taxonomic and ecological literature. This approach categorized species into size classes and trophic groups based on larval feeding habits, with a focus on capturing the ecosystem's functional diversity.
Vegetation: Vegetation cover and soil moisture were quantified using established scales and methods, and peat samples were analyzed for their chemical composition, including nutrients and pH levels. These environmental variables were assessed for their potential influence on insect community composition and diversity.
Statistical analysis: tailored to address the complexity of ecological data, focusing on species richness, dominance, and community composition. Techniques like rarefaction curves, non-parametric estimators, and diversity indices were applied to understand the diversity and abundance patterns among the different treatment areas. Community composition was analyzed using multivariate methods, including non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS), cluster analysis, and multi-response permutation procedures (MRPP), to examine the differentiation between sites and treatments.

Pipe Creek Wetland (PCW): A 40-ha, four-celled diked mitigation wetland managed by the Ohio Department of Natural Resources (ODNR).
Located on the west bank of Pipe Creek's mouth at eastern Sandusky Bay, part of Lake Erie's western basin. Historically part of Big Island Marsh, an emergent wetland prevalent in the late 1800s and early 1900s. Constructed in 1984 using clayey dredge spoil from a nearby channel for the bottoms of Cells B, C, and some of D. Water levels are managed through pumps and culverts, connecting the cells to each other and to Sandusky Bay.Since 1991, Cells C and D have been drained biennially in May to promote mudflat emergent germination for waterfowl, with partial refilling in August.

Located across from PCW, part of a continuous shoreline wetland running along Sandusky Bay's southern shore. Privately owned, with its water level naturally fluctuating with the bay.
Vegetation Surveys (1997): Conducted between July 4 and August 27, focusing on plant species diversity and cover. In PCW, sampling avoided dike and borrow-pit effects, starting 30 m from baselines, and compared high and low water years (1997 vs. 1994). In MHD, the first sampling point was 30 m from the shoreward dike, extending until the substrate dropped off into the bay.

This 23-ha area was designated for restoration as part of a mitigation agreement in 1983 to compensate for wetland loss due to airport construction. Originally a native salt marsh, the land was diked in the early 1900s for agricultural use but was later restored to its natural state in 1987 by breaching the dike. This action reintroduced tidal flooding, significantly altering the site's vegetation and hydrology. Two main areas were focused on: the restored marsh and a natural undiked marsh immediately seaward of the dike, serving as a reference for pre-dike conditions.
Sampling: In 1987, seven 1-m² species presence/absence plots were established from the breach across the marsh. In 1991, additional 1-m² plots for species coverage sampling were set along a 360-m transect through the restored site and a 145-m transect through the reference site to capture the elevation gradient. Sampling occurred annually from 1987 to 1998, with a break in 1995, during mid to late summer when marsh vegetation was fully developed.
Vegetation: Species presence and percentage cover were recorded, with cover estimated visually in 5% increments. Calibration exercises were conducted to ensure consistency among different samplers.
Data Analysis: Species Composition and Cover Similarity: Utilized the Czekanowski similarity index (also known as the Bray-Curtis index) to compare species composition and cover between years within each site and between the two sites for each year.

The site had been overtaken by reed canarygrass. In November 2006, 16 treatment and four control plots were established. Treatment involved clearing the vegetation and disking the soil to expose reed canarygrass rhizomes. Different pre-emergent herbicide treatments were applied over several years to control reed canarygrass and facilitate native vegetation recovery.
Herbicide Application: Various combinations of Oust® XP and Pendulum® were used, along with follow-up applications of other herbicides as needed to manage reed canarygrass and other unwanted species.
Vegetation Seeding: To supplement natural seed sources, additional seeds of green ash, black ash, river birch, and American elm were broadcasted across treated areas at different times.
Tree Cuttings: Cuttings of cottonwood, willow, and red osier dogwood were planted to evaluate their potential for restoration success in treated areas. Potted Plant Experiment: Conducted in 2008, reed canarygrass seeds were planted in forty-two 7.6-liter pots filled with Schultz® Garden Soil. After germination, seedlings were thinned to assigned densities reflecting various competition levels. Initial growth took place in a greenhouse until June, after which pots were moved outdoors. Silver maple seeds were added to each pot to study their growth amidst varying densities of reed canarygrass. Germination, survival, leaf number, and the biomass of silver maple seedlings were assessed.Sampling and Measurements: Permanent sample points were established in each plot for vegetation and seedling surveys conducted over three years. Measurements included percent cover of various plant species, the number of tree seedlings, and signs of deer browsing.
Statistical Analysis: Potted Plant Experiment: One-way ANOVA was used to analyze germination, leaf number, and biomass data.

Conservation project wetlands were enhanced or restored natural wetlands, managed with water level manipulation through constructed dikes and periodic drawdowns to mimic natural water fluctuations. Unmanaged wetlands were naturally occurring wetlands without NAWMP conservation actions.
Sampling: Bird surveys involved 10-minute observations made on 2-3 occasions from late May to early July, during which participants recorded all species seen or heard. Frog surveys consisted of 3-minute observations on 3 occasions from late March to early July, focusing on identifying species by sound. Both surveys incorporated weather and timing constraints to ensure favorable detection conditions and included broadcasting calls for elusive species. Site characteristics, including coverage of emergent vegetation, open water, trees and shrubs, and invasive species like purple loosestrife and common reed, were estimated annually by participants. Wetland and landscape characteristics were assessed using ArcGIS to analyze land cover and road density within buffer zones around each site.
Statistical analysis: Analysis of the data utilized single-season site occupancy models for each species to account for detection uncertainties. Management effects on occupancy were evaluated using an information theoretic approach and models that incorporated management status, survey conditions (date, daylight for birds; date, temperature for frogs), and spatial factors (latitude, longitude). The influence of management on species occupancy was assessed by comparing model-predicted estimates for conservation project sites versus unmanaged sites and calculating effect sizes to determine the impact of management actions on each species. Statistical analyses were performed using R software, employing specific packages for model fitting and analysis.","1995-2014","Birds","",NA,NA,1,1,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",""

Restoration of the site post peat extraction involved the moss-transfer technique. The surface of the peatland was flattened and leveled. Vegetation and the top layer of peat were removed and later used to block drainage ditches. A 5 to 10 cm thick layer of moss, dominated by Sphagnum rubellum and containing a mix of herbaceous species, was collected from a donor site and transferred to the restoration site at a ratio of 1:10. To protect plant fragments from desiccation and improve micro-climatic conditions, straw mulch was added over the transferred moss layer. Ditches were blocked every 50 m with compacted peat, and bunds were constructed to evenly distribute water across the site. Phosphorus was added to encourage the establishment of Polytrichum moss and reduce frost heaving.
Data Collection and Monitoring: Systematic monitoring was conducted to assess species composition in peat fields and ditches before and at multiple time points after restoration. Transects were established across the peat fields and ditches, with species touching a 2 cm diameter rod at each point recorded. Ground cover of herbaceous species was visually estimated in quadrats along a transect in both the experimental and reference sites. The reference ecosystem was composed of seven undisturbed bogs surveyed to provide a baseline for comparison.
Statistical Analysis: Shannon–Weaver diversity index was used to calculate species diversity. The Functional Dispersion Index (FDis) estimated the functional diversity based on selected plant traits. Paired t-test compared species diversity and functional diversity in peat fields and ditches before and after restoration.
Community Weighted Mean (CWM): The relative contribution of each species to its community was calculated, and CWM was used to obtain mean trait scores.
Principal Component Analysis (PCA): PCA was applied to the CWM matrix to illustrate associations between herbaceous community traits and different stand stages, including the reference ecosystem. Equiprobability ellipses visualized the trait diversity. Fourth-Corner Analysis: This analysis selected significant traits for further interpretation of the CWM analysis results.","PCA","Vegetation","",1,NA,1,1,1,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",""

The enclosures were placed over PVC collars set into the peat at different site types (natural, mined, restored, and naturally regenerated). Environmental Variables Monitoring: Environmental variables, including peat temperature at different depths, water table position, rainfall, and photosynthetically active radiation (PAR), were monitored continuously or measured manually several times per week at the different sites. Modeling CO2 Exchange: Continuous NEE was modeled for the different peatland communities using equations that account for gross ecosystem production (GEP), total respiration (RTOT), peat temperature, water table position, and PAR. Statistical analysis: Multi-linear regression was employed to estimate coefficients for the modeled RTOT based on peat temperature and water table position. This regression analysis provided a statistical basis for predicting total respiration across the various peatland conditions studied.

These sites offer varied conditions for comparing the GHG emissions associated with different peat extraction and land-use practices. 
Warming potential: The GWP index is used to compare emissions across different greenhouse gases (GHGs) over specific time horizons (e.g., 20, 100, 500 years), relative to CO2. Methane (CH4) is considered to have 23 times the GWP of CO2 over a 100-year horizon, as per Kyoto Protocol guidelines. The study notes that the GWP methodology may not fully capture the complexities of ecosystem GHG exchanges, which are continuous and variable.
Extraction Process Data Standardization: The study standardized emissions data by assuming a hypothetical 75-ha peatland extracted over 50 years using different techniques: vacuum harvesting (VH), block-cut (BC), and an alternative method (AT). Emissions were calculated based on the areas assigned to each peatland phase and multiplied by CO2 and CH4 emissions factors from field measurements and literature.
Natural Peatland Reserves: Emissions and Sinks - CO2 and CH4 emissions rates for natural reserves were derived from literature and field measurements, providing a baseline for comparison. Peatland Preparation: Ditching/Trenching - Emissions from trenching machinery were estimated based on fuel consumption and multiplied by GHG emissions factors for diesel combustion. The method accounts for daily and annual carbon emissions from drainage ditches, factoring in GWP differences between gases.
Production Phase: Peat Extraction and Processing - Emissions associated with peat extraction machinery and transport were calculated based on fuel consumption data and GHG emissions factors. Stockpile emissions are estimated from laboratory experiments simulating stockpile conditions, including temperature and moisture content.

This site was previously drained and vacuum extracted for peat until 1980, after which it was left abandoned until 1999. The study compares a restored section of this peatland to a neighboring unrestored section over a period of one year before restoration (1999) and three years post-restoration (2000-2002). The restoration process, initiated in autumn 1999, employed standard North American restoration techniques aimed at re-establishing a functional carbon-accumulating ecosystem. Key restoration activities included: Clearing the surface of all vegetation and woody material. Blocking drainage ditches and creating dykes to retain snowmelt. Spreading Sphagnum fragments from a donor peatland and protecting them with straw mulch. Applying phosphorus fertilizer to enhance the colonization by vascular plants.
Sampling:  The study investigated the CO2 exchange between the atmosphere and the peatland by measuring the net ecosystem exchange (NEE), ecosystem respiration (ER), and gross ecosystem photosynthesis (GEP) using chamber techniques across various vegetation types and bare peat areas. Measurements were taken several times a week during the growing season (May to early October) over the study period. The CO2 flux was calculated from the change in concentration over time, and these measurements were upscaled to the ecosystem level based on the proportion of each surface cover type. Environmental variables such as precipitation, temperature, peat moisture, water table position, and photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) were continuously measured at micrometeorological towers located in both the restored and cutover sites. These measurements helped in understanding the effects of restoration on the peatland's microclimate and hydrological conditions.
Data/Statistical Analysis: The growing season was divided into three periods (pregreen, green, and postgreen) for detailed analysis. GEP was modeled as a function of PAR using a non-rectangular hyperbola relationship, and empirical relationships between ER and environmental variables were determined using multiple linear regression. The total ecosystem NEE was calculated by weighting the carbon flux from each vegetation type by its total surface area.","","Abiotic","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",1,NA,1,1,1,"1","ecosystem respiration?"

Restored wetlands were previously drained croplands with restored hydrology, ranging from 3 to 11 years post-restoration.
Plant Sampling: Conducted once from late June through September 2011, during peak growing season to minimize temporal differences. Utilized three 10x10 meter quadrats randomly selected per plant community at each site, with adjustments for space limitations. All plant species within quadrats were assigned a percent cover class. Plants not identifiable in the field were collected for later identification. About 23% of plant observations not identifiable to species level were excluded from species-level calculations. Definitions for ""common"" and ""dominant"" species were based on occurrence and cover percentage criteria across the different site types.

A 2x2 factorial design was employed to explore the effects of two main factors: the presence/absence of fathead minnows and the drainage history (restored/never drained). This design created four groups of wetlands: restored with minnows, restored without minnows, natural with minnows, and natural without minnows.
Site Selection: Wetlands were chosen based on several criteria: presence or absence of fathead minnows, age since restoration (5–10 years), similar adjacent upland cover types, land use, hydroperiod, and other physical characteristics. The selection resulted in five wetlands for each category, spread across a large area in west-central Minnesota.
Sampling and Data Collection: Data were collected along five randomly selected transects in each wetland, extending from the wetland center to the edge. Two sampling stations were established on each transect: one in open water and one at the boundary of emergent vegetation. Fish, including fathead minnows, were sampled using minnow traps placed at emergent stations. The total biomass of fish captured was measured. Amphibian presence (larval and adult tiger salamanders, and larval frogs) was also assessed using the minnow traps. Aquatic invertebrates were sampled using integrated column samples and activity traps, collected every third week for a total of six sampling dates per year. Water samples were analyzed for total phosphorus, total nitrogen, chlorophyll a, and turbidity.
Statistical Analysis: Data were analyzed using 2x2 factorial ANOVA, with the presence/absence of fathead minnows and wetland history as the main effects. The study initially planned to assess the impact of fish removal via rotenone treatment in 1998 but adjusted the analysis due to the treatment's ineffectiveness in most wetlands.","","Abiotic","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,1,NA,NA,NA,"",1,NA,NA,NA,NA,"1","chlorophyll a from water samples "
